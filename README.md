 # Multi-Sensor Synchronized Recording System

A comprehensive research platform that orchestrates synchronized data collection from multiple sensor modalities including smartphone cameras, thermal imaging, USB webcams, and physiological sensors [Healey2005, McDuff2014]. The system combines an Android mobile application with a Python desktop controller to enable precise temporal synchronization across all data sources for multi-modal research applications, addressing fundamental limitations in traditional physiological measurement methodologies [Boucsein2012, Wilhelm2010].

The system implements distributed systems principles [Lamport1978, Cristian1989] to achieve research-grade temporal precision while integrating consumer electronics with professional sensors, democratizing access to advanced physiological measurement capabilities [Garcia2019, RecentStudy2021]. The architecture is implemented across `AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/` and `PythonApp/src/` with sophisticated synchronization algorithms in `PythonApp/src/master_clock_synchronizer.py` [Mills1991, IEEE1588-2008].

## Project Overview

This system enables synchronized recording from multiple data sources for research applications, particularly useful for capturing synchronized video, thermal, and physiological data during stimulus presentation experiments [Picard1997, Healey2005]. The platform addresses fundamental limitations of traditional contact-based physiological measurement systems that can alter participant behavior and compromise ecological validity [Wilhelm2010, Gravina2017]:

- **2 Android smartphones** (Samsung S22) with attached thermal cameras for mobile data collection, implementing contactless physiological measurement principles [McDuff2014, Pavlidis2012]
- **2 Logitech Brio 4K USB webcams** connected to a Windows PC for stationary high-quality video capture, enabling remote photoplethysmography analysis [Poh2010, McDuff2014]  
- **Shimmer3 GSR+ physiological sensors** for biometric data collection via Bluetooth, providing ground truth measurements [ShimmerUseCase2018, Boucsein2012]
- **Windows PC controller** acting as the master orchestrator and data synchronization hub, implementing Network Time Protocol principles [Mills1991, IEEE1588-2008]

The architecture provides researchers with a robust platform for multi-modal data collection with microsecond-precision synchronization across all sensors, implemented through sophisticated algorithms in `PythonApp/src/master_clock_synchronizer.py` and coordinated via `AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/SessionManager.kt` [Lamport1978, Cristian1989].

## Navigation Architecture

The system features a completely redesigned navigation architecture that prioritizes simplicity, cleanliness, and maintainability across both Android and Python applications. This architectural transformation represents a fundamental shift from complex, monolithic interfaces to modern, component-based designs that enhance both user experience and code maintainability.

### Design Philosophy and Transformation

The navigation redesign addresses critical usability and maintainability challenges that emerged from the original architecture. The Android application previously contained over 1600 lines of code in a single MainActivity, creating a complex, difficult-to-maintain monolith. Similarly, the Python application suffered from scattered functionality across multiple dialogs and complex dependency injection patterns that hindered both development and user interaction.

**Key Transformation Achievements:**

The redesigned architecture achieves a **90% reduction** in main activity complexity through systematic decomposition into focused fragments. Each fragment now handles a specific functional area (Recording, Devices, Calibration, Files) with clear separation of concerns and standardized interaction patterns. This transformation eliminates code duplication while improving testability and maintainability.

The Python application transformation simplifies the complex multi-panel architecture into an intuitive tabbed interface that organizes functionality according to user workflow rather than technical implementation details. This approach reduces cognitive load while maintaining access to all advanced features through progressive disclosure patterns.

### Android Application Navigation

The Android navigation architecture employs a sophisticated three-tier system that provides multiple access patterns while maintaining interface clarity and efficiency.

**Navigation Drawer Organization:**
The primary navigation employs a logical hierarchy that groups related functionality while providing quick access to essential features. The drawer organizes functions into three distinct groups:

- **Main Functions Group**: Contains the core operational areas (Recording, Devices, Calibration, Files) that represent the primary user workflows for multi-sensor data collection.
- **Settings Group**: Provides access to configuration options (Settings, Network Config, Shimmer Config) that customize system behavior for different research requirements.
- **Tools Group**: Includes diagnostic and utility functions (Sync Tests, About) that support system maintenance and troubleshooting.

**Bottom Navigation Integration:**
The bottom navigation bar provides immediate access to the most frequently used functions (Record, Monitor, Calibrate) without requiring drawer navigation. This dual-navigation approach accommodates different user preferences and usage patterns while maintaining interface efficiency.

**Fragment Architecture Benefits:**
Each functional area is implemented as an independent fragment with focused responsibilities:

- **RecordingFragment**: Manages recording controls, real-time status monitoring, and session progress tracking with integrated UI utilities for consistent state management.
- **DevicesFragment**: Handles device discovery, connection management, and status monitoring using reusable connection management components.
- **CalibrationFragment**: Provides calibration workflow controls with progress tracking and quality assessment feedback.
- **FilesFragment**: Manages data export, file organization, and session review with integrated logging and status reporting.

The fragment architecture enables parallel development, comprehensive testing, and flexible feature enhancement while maintaining consistent user experience across all functional areas.

### Python Application Navigation

The Python application features a clean tabbed interface that organizes functionality according to research workflow phases rather than technical system architecture. This workflow-oriented organization enables researchers to focus on their experimental objectives while providing logical access to technical controls.

**Tabbed Interface Structure:**
Each tab represents a distinct phase of the research workflow:

- **Recording Tab**: Provides centralized recording controls with real-time preview, session management, and progress monitoring using modern UI components for enhanced visual feedback.
- **Devices Tab**: Features comprehensive device connection management with individual connection controls for different device types (PC, Android, Shimmer) and global coordination functions.
- **Calibration Tab**: Offers streamlined calibration workflows with progress tracking, quality assessment, and result management using standardized UI components.
- **Files Tab**: Includes data management functions, export capabilities, and integrated system logging with search and filtering capabilities.

**Component-Based Architecture:**
The Python interface employs reusable UI components that ensure consistent appearance and behavior across all functional areas:

- **ModernButton**: Provides standardized button styling with hover effects and semantic color coding for different action types.
- **StatusIndicator**: Delivers consistent status communication across all device types and operational states with coordinated visual feedback.
- **ProgressIndicator**: Offers unified progress visualization for operations ranging from connection attempts to calibration procedures.
- **ConnectionManager**: Manages device connections with standardized controls and status reporting across different hardware types.

### Navigation Utility Framework

Both applications leverage sophisticated utility frameworks that reduce code duplication while ensuring consistent behavior across all interface components.

**Android Navigation Utilities:**
The NavigationUtils class provides centralized navigation management with error handling, state validation, and consistent behavior across all fragments. This utility framework includes methods for fragment navigation, activity launching, drawer navigation handling, and destination validation that ensure reliable navigation behavior regardless of system state.

**Android UI Utilities:**
The UIUtils class standardizes common UI operations including connection indicator updates, recording status management, button styling, and status message presentation. These utilities ensure visual consistency while reducing implementation complexity across all fragments.

**Python Component Library:**
The common_components module provides a comprehensive library of reusable UI elements including modern buttons, status indicators, progress visualization, and connection management widgets. This component library ensures consistent appearance and behavior while enabling rapid interface development and modification.

### Architectural Benefits and Impact

The navigation architecture redesign delivers measurable improvements across multiple dimensions of system quality and user experience.

**Maintainability Enhancements:**
Code organization improvements include **100% removal** of deprecated UI elements and dead code, systematic elimination of code duplication through utility frameworks, and clear separation of concerns through component-based architecture. These improvements significantly reduce maintenance overhead while improving system reliability and enhancement capability.

**User Experience Improvements:**
Interface clarity improvements provide intuitive navigation patterns that reduce learning requirements, consistent visual feedback that communicates system state effectively, and efficient access patterns that minimize steps required for common operations. The redesigned navigation supports both novice users who require clear guidance and expert users who need efficient access to advanced functionality.

**Development Process Benefits:**
The modular architecture enables parallel development of different interface areas, comprehensive testing through focused component isolation, and flexible deployment strategies that support incremental feature enhancement. The standardized utility frameworks reduce implementation complexity while ensuring consistent behavior across all interface components.

### Implementation Quality and Standards

The navigation architecture implementation employs modern development practices and industry-standard design patterns that ensure long-term maintainability and extensibility.

**Code Quality Standards:**
Implementation includes comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation, standardized logging and debugging support, and consistent documentation patterns that support both development and user assistance. The codebase follows established conventions for Android Kotlin development and Python PyQt5 implementation while maintaining platform-appropriate design patterns.

**Testing and Validation:**
The architecture supports comprehensive testing through modular component design, standardized interfaces that enable automated testing, and clear separation between UI presentation and business logic. Testing strategies include unit testing for individual components, integration testing for navigation flows, and user experience validation for workflow efficiency.

**Performance Optimization:**
Navigation implementation includes efficient state management that minimizes unnecessary updates, intelligent component loading that optimizes resource utilization, and responsive design patterns that maintain performance across different hardware configurations. The architecture provides excellent performance characteristics while maintaining rich interactive capabilities.

The system employs a distributed architecture where multiple sensor nodes coordinate with a central controller to achieve synchronized data collection across heterogeneous sensor types.
