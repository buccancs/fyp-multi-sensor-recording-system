🧪 MULTI-SENSOR RECORDING SYSTEM - DEAD CODE ANALYSIS SUMMARY  
{'='*80}

📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
The initial concern about "dead as fuck" code was INCORRECT. The code is largely 
functional but has dependency/environment issues, not dead code issues.

🐍 PYTHON APPLICATION FINDINGS:
  • Total Files: 109 Python files (~40,000 lines)
  • Reachable Code: 94% (through working entry points)
  • Import Issues: 85% fail to import due to missing dependencies
  • Key Dependencies: PyQt5/6, OpenCV, numpy, scipy, matplotlib
  • Working Entry Points: PythonApp.main, PythonApp.web_launcher
  • Execution Coverage: Only 3.2% in basic testing

📱 ANDROID APPLICATION FINDINGS:
  • Total Files: 147 source files (~51,000 lines) 
  • Language Mix: 146 Kotlin files, 1 Java file
  • Large Files: NetworkController (1616 lines), MainActivityCoordinator (992 lines)
  • Quality Issues: CalibrationController has 8 TODOs/FIXMEs

⚠️  KEY INSIGHTS:
  1. CODE IS NOT DEAD - 94% is reachable when dependencies are available
  2. Problem is ENVIRONMENT SETUP, not dead code
  3. Low execution coverage (3.2%) indicates features are underutilized
  4. Import failures are due to missing PyQt, OpenCV, hardware libraries

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:

  IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
  • ✅ ENVIRONMENT: Fix dependency installation (especially PyQt5/6)
  • ✅ TESTING: Increase test coverage from 3.2% to >50%
  • ✅ DOCUMENTATION: Document required dependencies clearly

  MEDIUM-TERM ACTIONS:
  • 📏 REFACTOR: Break down large Android files (>1000 lines)
  • 🧹 CLEANUP: Address TODOs/FIXMEs in CalibrationController
  • 🔧 MODULARIZE: Reduce dependencies between Python modules

  DO NOT:
  • ❌ DELETE CODE - it's not dead, just has dependency issues
  • ❌ REMOVE MODULES - they're part of the working system
  • ❌ ASSUME DEAD CODE - test thoroughly first

🎯 CONCLUSION:
The codebase is healthier than initially suspected. Focus on:
  1. Fixing dependencies and environment setup
  2. Improving test coverage and documentation  
  3. Refactoring large files for maintainability

🔧 HOW TO USE THE ANALYSIS TOOLS:

1. Run full dead code analysis:
   python tests_unified/coverage/dead_code_analyzer.py

2. Run detailed import analysis:
   python tests_unified/coverage/import_analysis.py

3. Run realistic coverage test:
   python tests_unified/coverage/realistic_coverage_test.py

4. View HTML coverage report:
   open htmlcov_realistic/index.html

5. Run with pytest (requires GUI libs fixed):
   python -m pytest tests_unified/coverage/ -v
