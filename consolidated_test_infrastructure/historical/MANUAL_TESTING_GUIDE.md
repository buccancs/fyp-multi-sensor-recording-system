- [ ] Messages are readable and informative
- [ ] No app crashes when Toast functions are called
- [ ] Toast messages don't interfere with other UI elements
- [ ] Messages display correctly in both portrait and landscape orientations

## Samsung-Specific Considerations

- **One UI Interface**: Verify Toast messages display correctly with Samsung's One UI theme
- **Edge Display**: On Samsung Edge devices, ensure Toast messages are fully visible
- **Dark Mode**: Test Toast visibility in both light and dark themes
- **Accessibility**: Verify Toast messages work with Samsung's accessibility features (TalkBack, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### If Toast Messages Don't Appear:

1. Check if "Show notifications" is enabled in app settings
2. Verify the app has proper permissions
3. Check if Samsung's "Do Not Disturb" mode is affecting notifications
4. Restart the app and try again

### If App Crashes:

1. Check logcat for error messages
2. Verify the Toast import is present: `import android.widget.Toast`
3. Ensure the functions are called from the main UI thread

## Completion Criteria

✅ All Toast messages display correctly on Samsung device
✅ Appropriate durations are observed (SHORT vs LONG)
✅ No crashes or UI issues
✅ Messages are user-friendly and informative
✅ Consistent behavior across different Samsung device models and Android versions

## Notes

- This testing should be performed after each build to ensure Toast functionality remains intact
- Test on multiple Samsung device models if available (Galaxy S series, Note series, etc.)
- Document any device-specific issues or variations in behavior
- Consider testing with different Android API levels supported by the app
