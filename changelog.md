### Attempted Fix - Robolectric Windows POSIX Permissions Issue
- **Comprehensive Windows Compatibility Configuration**: Implemented extensive configuration changes to address the persistent POSIX permissions error on Windows
  - **Root Cause**: Google Guava's `TempFileCreator$JavaNioCreator.createTempDir()` method attempts to set POSIX file permissions on Windows, which is not supported
  - **Error Pattern**: `'posix:permissions' not supported as initial attribute` in `com.google.common.io.TempFileCreator.java:102`
  - **Attempted Solutions**:
    - Enhanced `robolectric.properties` with Windows-specific temp directory configuration
    - Added system properties to disable POSIX file attributes: `java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider.installedProviders=sun.nio.fs.WindowsFileSystemProvider`
    - Configured Windows-compatible temp directory handling with `${java.io.tmpdir}` variables
    - Added comprehensive JVM arguments in `build.gradle` for file system compatibility
    - Implemented additional system properties: `sun.nio.fs.useCanonicalPrefixCache=false`, `sun.nio.fs.useCanonicalCache=false`
    - Added security manager configuration: `-Djava.security.manager=allow`
  - **Result**: Issue persists despite comprehensive configuration changes
  - **Status**: This is a fundamental upstream issue in Robolectric's dependency on Google Guava for Windows environments

### Technical Implementation Details
- **AndroidApp/src/test/resources/robolectric.properties**: Enhanced Windows compatibility
  - Added Windows-specific temp directory configuration using system properties
  - Configured file system provider settings to use Windows-compatible operations
  - Added Maven dependency caching configuration for Windows
  - Disabled problematic file system caching features
- **AndroidApp/build.gradle**: Comprehensive Windows JVM configuration
  - Added system properties for Windows file system provider configuration
  - Enhanced JVM arguments for Google Guava compatibility on Windows
  - Added file system module access permissions
  - Configured security manager for Windows compatibility
- **gradle.properties**: Maintained existing Windows/Java 21 compatibility settings

### Current Status and Recommendations
- **Issue Confirmed**: POSIX permissions error still occurs in `MavenArtifactFetcher.fetchArtifact()` during Robolectric initialization
- **Upstream Problem**: This is a known limitation of Robolectric's Windows support, specifically in Google Guava's temp file creation
- **Workaround**: Use business logic tests (non-Robolectric) which work correctly on all platforms
- **Alternative**: Consider migrating to alternative testing frameworks or await upstream fixes
- **Development Guidance**: Windows developers should focus on business logic tests and integration tests rather than Robolectric-based unit tests

### Fixed - Robolectric Dependency Resolution Issue
- **Resolved Robolectric Offline Mode Dependency Error**: Fixed critical issue where Robolectric unit tests were failing due to missing android-all-instrumented JAR files
  - **Root Cause**: Robolectric was configured with `robolectric.offline=true` which forced local dependency resolution, but required JAR files were not present locally
  - **Error Pattern**: `Unable to locate dependency: '.\android-all-instrumented-x-robolectric-x-i6.jar'` and `Path is not a file` errors
  - **Solution**: Disabled offline mode to enable automatic dependency downloads from Maven Central
  - **Technical Changes**:
    - Removed `systemProperty 'robolectric.offline', 'true'` from build.gradle testOptions
    - Configured proper Maven Central repository access for Robolectric dependencies
    - Updated robolectric.properties with dependency repository configuration
    - Maintained existing Windows/Java 21 compatibility settings

### Technical Implementation
- **AndroidApp/build.gradle**: Updated testOptions configuration
  - **Removed Offline Mode**: Eliminated `robolectric.offline=true` to allow online dependency resolution
  - **Enhanced Repository Configuration**: Maintained `robolectric.dependency.repo.url` and `robolectric.dependency.repo.id` for Maven Central access
  - **Preserved Windows Compatibility**: Kept existing JVM arguments for Windows/Java 21 compatibility
- **AndroidApp/src/test/resources/robolectric.properties**: Enhanced Windows compatibility
  - **Added Dependency Configuration**: Included `dependency.repo.url` and `dependency.repo.id` properties
  - **Maintained SDK Configuration**: Preserved SDK 28 configuration for Windows compatibility
  - **Enhanced Documentation**: Updated comments explaining Windows-specific settings

### Dependency Resolution Flow
- **Before**: Offline mode → Local JAR file lookup → File not found → Test failure
- **After**: Online mode → Maven Central download → Dependency caching → Successful resolution
- **Fallback**: Multiple repository configuration ensures reliable dependency access
- **Caching**: Downloaded dependencies are cached locally for subsequent test runs

### Known Limitation - Windows POSIX Permissions Issue
- **Robolectric Windows Compatibility**: Unit tests using Robolectric still encounter Windows-specific POSIX permissions errors
  - **Error Pattern**: `'posix:permissions' not supported as initial attribute` in `com.google.common.io.TempFileCreator`
  - **Root Cause**: Google Guava library within Robolectric attempts to set POSIX file permissions on Windows
  - **Impact**: Robolectric-based tests fail on Windows with Java 17+ due to file system compatibility issues
  - **Workaround**: Use business logic tests (non-Robolectric) which work correctly on all platforms
  - **Status**: This is a known upstream issue in Robolectric's Windows support
  - **Future**: Consider migrating to alternative testing framework or await Robolectric Windows fixes

### Benefits Achieved
- **Resolved Dependency Resolution**: Robolectric can now download required Android SDK JAR files automatically
- **Eliminated Local File Dependencies**: No longer requires manual JAR file management
- **Improved Build Reliability**: Tests can run on fresh environments without pre-cached dependencies
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Clear guidance on Windows compatibility limitations
- **Maintained Existing Functionality**: All non-Robolectric tests continue to work correctly

### Fixed - Background Location Permission Retry Loop Issue
- **Resolved Infinite Permission Retry Loop**: Fixed critical issue where the app was stuck in an infinite retry loop when requesting background location permissions
  - **Root Cause**: App was requesting `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` before user granted foreground location permissions (`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`)
  - **Android Requirement**: Since Android 10 (API 29), background location permissions can only be requested AFTER foreground location permissions are granted
  - **Problem**: When background location was denied (because foreground wasn't granted), the retry mechanism kept requesting the same permission bundle, creating an infinite loop
  - **Solution**: Implemented sequential location permission request system that respects Android's permission hierarchy

### Technical Implementation
- **PermissionTool.kt**: Enhanced with three-phase sequential permission system
  - **Phase 1**: Non-location permissions (camera, microphone, storage, phone, SMS, contacts, calendar, sensors, notifications)
  - **Phase 2**: Foreground location permissions (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION) 
  - **Phase 3**: Background location permissions (ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION) - only requested if Phase 2 succeeds
  - **New getForegroundLocationPermissions()**: Returns only foreground location permissions
  - **New getBackgroundLocationPermissions()**: Returns only background location permission
  - **Updated getLocationPermissions()**: Now combines both for compatibility but notes they should be requested sequentially
  - **New ThreePhasePermissionCallback**: Replaces TwoPhasePermissionCallback with proper sequential logic

### Sequential Permission Flow
- **Phase 1 → Phase 2**: Non-location permissions → Foreground location permissions
- **Phase 2 → Phase 3**: Foreground location permissions → Background location permissions (only if Phase 2 succeeds)
- **Critical Logic**: If foreground location is denied, background location is NOT requested, breaking the retry loop
- **Retry Prevention**: System logs "Foreground location denied, skipping background location request" and reports denied permissions without infinite retries

### Permission Request Logic Changes
- **Before**: All location permissions (foreground + background) requested together → Android denies background → Infinite retry loop
- **After**: Foreground location requested first → If granted, then request background → If denied, skip background and break loop
- **Loop Breaking**: When foreground location is denied, the system does not attempt to request background location, eliminating the retry loop
- **Android Compliance**: Follows Android's sequential permission requirements for location permissions

### Benefits Achieved
- **Eliminates Infinite Retry Loop**: App no longer gets stuck requesting background location without foreground location
- **Proper Android Compliance**: Follows Android 10+ sequential location permission requirements
- **Better User Experience**: Users see logical permission flow (foreground first, then background)
- **Maintains Functionality**: All permissions are still requested, just in the correct sequence
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Comprehensive logging shows permission flow and loop prevention logic
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of denial scenarios without infinite loops

### Fixed - XXPermissions Background Location Restriction Issue
- **Resolved IllegalArgumentException**: Fixed critical crash caused by XXPermissions library restriction when requesting background location permissions with other unrelated permissions
  - **Root Cause**: XXPermissions library enforces that background location permissions cannot be requested together with non-location permissions in a single request
  - **Error Message**: "Because it includes background location permissions, do not apply for permissions unrelated to location"
  - **Solution**: Implemented two-phase permission request system to separate location and non-location permissions
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - **Phase 1**: Request all non-location dangerous permissions (camera, microphone, storage, phone, SMS, contacts, calendar, sensors, notifications)
    - **Phase 2**: Request location permissions separately (fine location, coarse location, background location)
    - **TwoPhasePermissionCallback**: Custom callback class that manages the sequential permission requests and combines results
    - **Separated Permission Methods**: Created `getNonLocationDangerousPermissions()` and `getLocationPermissions()` methods
    - **Maintained Compatibility**: Existing MainActivity code works unchanged with the new two-phase system

### Technical Implementation Details
- **PermissionTool.kt**: Enhanced permission handling system
  - **Updated requestAllDangerousPermissions()**: Now uses two-phase approach to avoid XXPermissions library restrictions
  - **New getNonLocationDangerousPermissions()**: Returns all dangerous permissions except location-related ones
  - **New getLocationPermissions()**: Returns only location permissions (including background location)
  - **New TwoPhasePermissionCallback**: Manages sequential permission requests and combines denied permissions from both phases
  - **Refactored getAllDangerousPermissions()**: Now combines results from separated permission methods
  - **Maintained Existing Interface**: No changes needed to PermissionCallback interface or MainActivity integration

### Permission Request Flow
- **Phase 1**: Request camera, microphone, storage, phone, SMS, contacts, calendar, sensors, notifications permissions
- **Phase 2**: Request fine location, coarse location, and background location permissions (if Phase 1 completes)
- **Result Combination**: Denied permissions from both phases are combined and reported to the original callback
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of failures in either phase with proper fallback mechanisms

### Benefits Achieved
- **Eliminates Fatal Crash**: App no longer crashes with IllegalArgumentException on permission requests
- **Maintains Full Functionality**: All dangerous permissions are still requested, just in proper sequence
- **XXPermissions Compliance**: Follows XXPermissions library restrictions for background location permissions

  - **Solution**: Changed MainActivity to use `getDangerousPermissions()` instead of `getAllPermissions()`
  - **Impact**: Now only requests runtime-grantable dangerous permissions, ensuring proper permission grants
  - **Technical Details**: 
    - System-level permissions (BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN, BIND_INPUT_METHOD, etc.) cannot be granted via runtime requests
    - Special permissions (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW, WRITE_SETTINGS) require separate handling through Settings intents
    - Dangerous permissions are the only ones that can be granted through ActivityResultContracts.RequestMultiplePermissions()
  - **Result**: Permission requests now work correctly, allowing users to grant necessary runtime permissions

### Technical Implementation
- **MainActivity.kt**: Updated permission request logic
  - Changed `requiredPermissions` from `AllAndroidPermissions.getAllPermissions()` to `AllAndroidPermissions.getDangerousPermissions()`
  - Updated comment to clarify that only runtime permissions are being requested
  - Maintained existing permission launcher and result handling logic
