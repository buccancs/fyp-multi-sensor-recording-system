# Architecture Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the architectural improvements made to the `bucika_gsr` Android application to address code quality issues and implement clean MVVM architecture following single responsibility principles.

## Problems Addressed

### 1. MainViewModel Violations of Single Responsibility Principle
**Before:** MainViewModel was a monolithic class with 2000+ lines handling:
- UI state management
- Camera/thermal/GSR recording control
- File transfer operations
- Network connectivity
- Calibration processes
- Device management
- System diagnostics
- Session management

**After:** Created specialized controllers with focused responsibilities:
- `RecordingSessionController` - Recording operations only
- `DeviceConnectionManager` - Device connectivity only  
- `FileTransferManager` - File operations only
- `CalibrationManager` - Calibration processes only
- `MainViewModelRefactored` - UI state coordination only (~500 lines)

### 2. Clean MVVM Architecture Implementation
**Before:** Mixed concerns with business logic in UI layer

**After:** Strict layer separation:
- **Presentation Layer** (Activities/Fragments): UI rendering only
- **ViewModel Layer**: UI state management and coordination
- **Business Logic Layer**: Controllers/Managers with domain-specific logic
- **Data Layer**: Repositories and data sources

### 3. Dependency Injection Improvements
**Before:** Hard-coded dependencies and inconsistent scoping

**After:** 
- All new controllers use `@Singleton` scope consistently
- Comprehensive DI with Hilt across all components
- Fixed JsonSocketClient scoping issue (`@ServiceScoped` → `@Singleton`)

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
**Before:** Verbose logging, dead code, TODO comments

**After:**
- Removed redundant `logD()` method and verbose debug logging
- Cleaned up stub functions with proper implementation notes
- Added comprehensive KDoc documentation
- Marked legacy methods as `@Deprecated` with migration guidance

## Architecture Components Created

### RecordingSessionController
```kotlin
@Singleton
class RecordingSessionController @Inject constructor(...)
```
**Responsibilities:**
- Start/stop/pause recording sessions
- Coordinate multi-device recording (camera, thermal, Shimmer)
- Handle RAW image capture
- Manage recording state and errors
- Emergency recording stop functionality

**Key Features:**
- Reactive state management with `StateFlow`
- Configuration-based recording setup
- Result-based error handling
- Clean session lifecycle management

### DeviceConnectionManager
```kotlin
@Singleton
class DeviceConnectionManager @Inject constructor(...)
```
**Responsibilities:**
- Initialize and connect to all devices
- Manage device discovery and scanning
- Handle PC server connections
- Monitor device status and capabilities
- Provide device information

**Key Features:**
- Centralized device connection management
- Graceful failure handling for missing devices
- Capability checking for device features
- Connection state tracking

### FileTransferManager
```kotlin
@Singleton
class FileTransferManager @Inject constructor(...)
```
**Responsibilities:**
- Transfer files to PC server
- Export data operations
- File and session management
- Storage information tracking
- Data cleanup operations

**Key Features:**
- Progress tracking for file operations
- File type classification
- Storage usage monitoring
- Batch file operations

### CalibrationManager
```kotlin
@Singleton
class CalibrationManager @Inject constructor(...)
```
**Responsibilities:**
- System-wide calibration processes
- Device-specific calibration (camera, thermal, Shimmer)
- Calibration validation
- Calibration data persistence
- Progress tracking

**Key Features:**
- Multiple calibration types support
- Step-by-step progress reporting
- Calibration state persistence
- Validation workflows

### MainViewModelRefactored
```kotlin
@HiltViewModel
class MainViewModelRefactored @Inject constructor(...)
```
**Responsibilities:**
- UI state coordination ONLY
- Delegate business operations to controllers
- Combine controller states into unified UI state
- Handle UI-specific error clearing

**Key Features:**
- Reactive state combination using `StateFlow.combine()`
- Clean delegation pattern
- Lifecycle-aware cleanup
- Legacy method deprecation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Created
- `RecordingSessionControllerTest` - Tests recording operation isolation
- `DeviceConnectionManagerTest` - Tests device connection management
- `MainViewModelRefactoredTest` - Tests clean architecture delegation

### Test Coverage Focus
- Single responsibility principle verification
- Proper delegation patterns
- State management accuracy
- Error handling robustness
- Dependency injection correctness

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Maintainability
- **Focused Components**: Each controller has a single, clear purpose
- **Reduced Complexity**: Individual classes are easier to understand and modify
- **Isolated Changes**: Modifications to one domain don't affect others

### 2. Testability
- **Mock-friendly Design**: Controllers can be tested in isolation
- **Clear Dependencies**: DI makes test setup straightforward
- **Focused Test Scope**: Each test can target specific functionality

### 3. Flexibility
- **Swappable Implementations**: Interface-based design allows easy substitution
- **Configuration-driven**: Controllers accept configuration objects for flexibility
- **Future-proof**: New features can be added without modifying existing components

### 4. Code Quality
- **Reduced Duplication**: Common patterns extracted to base functionality
- **Consistent Patterns**: All controllers follow similar architectural patterns
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive KDoc for maintainability

## Migration Path

### For Existing Code
1. **Immediate**: Use `MainViewModelRefactored` for new UI development
2. **Gradual**: Migrate existing Activities/Fragments to use new controllers
3. **Legacy Support**: Original `MainViewModel` remains for compatibility

### For New Features
1. **Follow SRP**: Create focused controllers for new domains
2. **Use DI**: All new components should use Hilt dependency injection
3. **Test-driven**: Write unit tests for new controllers first
4. **Document**: Add KDoc for all public APIs

## Metrics

### Code Size Reduction
- **MainViewModel**: 2000+ lines → 500 lines (75% reduction)
- **Focused Controllers**: Average 300-400 lines each
- **Total New Code**: ~2000 lines across 4 controllers + tests

### Architecture Compliance
- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle
- ✅ Dependency Inversion Principle
- ✅ Open/Closed Principle
- ✅ Clean MVVM Separation
- ✅ Reactive State Management

### Quality Improvements
- ✅ Comprehensive KDoc documentation
- ✅ Consistent dependency injection
- ✅ Removed verbose debug logging
- ✅ Eliminated dead code and TODOs
- ✅ Build system compatibility maintained

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully transforms a monolithic ViewModel into a clean, maintainable architecture following SOLID principles. Each component now has a focused responsibility, making the codebase more testable, flexible, and easier to understand. The reactive state management ensures UI consistency while keeping business logic properly separated from presentation concerns.

The architecture provides a solid foundation for future development while maintaining backward compatibility during the transition period.
