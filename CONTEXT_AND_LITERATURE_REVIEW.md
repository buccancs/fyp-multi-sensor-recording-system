## Introduction and Research Context

The Multi-Sensor Recording System emerges from the rapidly evolving field of contactless physiological measurement, representing a significant advancement in research instrumentation that addresses fundamental limitations of traditional electrode-based approaches. Pioneering work in noncontact physiological measurement using webcams has demonstrated the potential for camera-based monitoring [Poh et al., 2010], while advances in biomedical engineering have established the theoretical foundations for remote physiological detection. The research context encompasses the intersection of distributed systems engineering, mobile computing, computer vision, and psychophysiological measurement, requiring sophisticated integration of diverse technological domains to achieve research-grade precision and reliability.

Traditional physiological measurement methodologies impose significant constraints on research design and data quality that have limited scientific progress in understanding human physiological responses. The comprehensive handbook of psychophysiology documents these longstanding limitations [Cacioppo et al., 2007], while extensive research on electrodermal activity has identified the fundamental challenges of contact-based measurement approaches [Boucsein, 2012]. Contact-based measurement approaches, particularly for galvanic skin response (GSR) monitoring, require direct electrode attachment that can alter the very responses being studied, restrict experimental designs to controlled laboratory settings, and create participant discomfort that introduces measurement artifacts.

The development of contactless measurement approaches represents a paradigm shift toward naturalistic observation methodologies that preserve measurement accuracy while eliminating the behavioral artifacts associated with traditional instrumentation. Advanced research in remote photoplethysmographic detection using digital cameras has demonstrated the feasibility of precise cardiovascular monitoring without physical contact, establishing the scientific foundation for contactless physiological measurement.

The interpretive nature of Python enables rapid prototyping and experimental development approaches that accommodate the evolving requirements typical in research software development.

Alternative languages including C++, Java, and C# were evaluated for desktop controller implementation, with C++ offering superior performance characteristics but requiring significantly higher development time and complexity for equivalent functionality. Java provides cross-platform compatibility and mature enterprise frameworks but lacks the comprehensive scientific computing ecosystem essential for research data analysis, while C# provides excellent development productivity but restricts deployment to Windows platforms that would limit research community accessibility.

**PyQt5 vs. Alternative GUI Framework Analysis**: The selection of PyQt5 for the desktop GUI reflects comprehensive evaluation of cross-platform compatibility, widget sophistication, community support, and long-term sustainability. PyQt5 provides native platform integration across Windows, macOS, and Linux that ensures consistent user experience across diverse research computing environments, while alternative frameworks including Tkinter, wxPython, and Kivy offer limited native integration or restricted platform support.

The PyQt5 framework provides sophisticated widget capabilities including custom graphics widgets, advanced layout management, and comprehensive styling options that enable professional user interface design while maintaining the functional requirements essential for research operations. The QtDesigner integration enables visual interface design and rapid prototyping while maintaining separation between visual design and application logic that supports maintainable code architecture.

Alternative GUI frameworks were systematically evaluated: Tkinter provides limited visual design capabilities and outdated interface aesthetics; wxPython lacks comprehensive documentation and community support; and web-based frameworks like Electron introduce additional complexity for hardware integration that would compromise sensor coordination capabilities. The PyQt5 selection provides an optimal balance between development productivity, user interface quality, and technical capability essential for research software applications.

### Communication Protocol and Architecture Decisions

**WebSocket vs. Alternative Protocol Evaluation**: The selection of WebSocket for real-time device communication reflects systematic analysis of latency characteristics, reliability requirements, firewall compatibility, and implementation complexity. WebSocket provides bidirectional communication with minimal protocol overhead while maintaining compatibility with standard HTTP infrastructure, simplifying network configuration in research environments with restrictive IT policies.

The WebSocket protocol enables both command-and-control communication and real-time data streaming through a single connection, reducing network complexity while providing comprehensive error handling and automatic reconnection capabilities essential for reliable research operations. Alternative protocols including raw TCP, UDP, and MQTT were evaluated: raw TCP requires additional protocol implementation complexity, UDP lacks reliability guarantees essential for research data integrity, and MQTT adds broker dependency that increases system complexity and introduces additional failure modes.

The WebSocket implementation includes sophisticated connection management with automatic reconnection, message queuing during temporary disconnections, and adaptive quality control that maintains communication reliability despite network variability typical in research environments. The protocol design enables both high-frequency sensor data streaming and low-latency command execution while maintaining the simplicity essential for research software development and troubleshooting.

**JSON vs. Binary Protocol Decision**: The selection of JSON for message serialization reflects comprehensive evaluation of human readability, debugging capability, schema validation, and development productivity considerations. JSON provides human-readable message formats that facilitate debugging and system monitoring while supporting comprehensive schema validation and automatic code generation that reduce development errors and ensure protocol reliability.
