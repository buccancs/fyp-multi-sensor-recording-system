# Android App Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the critical improvements needed and implemented for the Android mobile application within the Multi-Sensor Recording System. The Android app serves as a sophisticated mobile data collection platform that coordinates with a Python desktop controller to achieve research-grade temporal synchronization across multiple sensor modalities.

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Compilation Failures - ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue**: The Android application failed to build due to multiple compilation errors blocking development and deployment.

**Root Causes Identified:**
- **Hilt Dependency Injection Scoping Conflict**: `JsonSocketClient` was annotated with `@ServiceScoped` but injected into `MainViewModel` which uses `@ViewModelScoped`, creating an incompatible dependency graph
- **Android Manifest Merger Conflict**: The application's `android:allowBackup="false"` setting conflicted with the Shimmer library's `android:allowBackup="true"` requirement
- **Test Infrastructure Misalignment**: Unit tests contained outdated constructor parameters that didn't match the current implementation

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### Hilt Scoping Resolution
```kotlin
// BEFORE: Incompatible scoping
@ServiceScoped
class JsonSocketClient

// AFTER: Compatible singleton scoping  
@Singleton
class JsonSocketClient
```

**Rationale**: `JsonSocketClient` needs to be shared across different application components and should live longer than individual ViewModels. Singleton scope provides the appropriate lifecycle management while maintaining compatibility with Hilt's dependency injection hierarchy.

#### Manifest Merger Conflict Resolution
```xml
<!-- BEFORE: Conflict with Shimmer library -->
<application
    android:allowBackup="false"
    tools:replace="android:label">

<!-- AFTER: Explicit conflict resolution -->
<application
    android:allowBackup="false"
    tools:replace="android:label,android:allowBackup">
```

**Impact**: This resolves the build-time manifest merger failure and allows the application to compile successfully while maintaining the desired backup policy.

#### Test Infrastructure Updates
```kotlin
// BEFORE: Outdated constructor
viewModel = MainViewModel(
    mockCameraRecorder,
    mockThermalRecorder,
    // ... missing parameters
)

// AFTER: Complete constructor matching current implementation
viewModel = MainViewModel(
    mockContext,
    mockCameraRecorder,
    mockThermalRecorder,
    mockShimmerRecorder,
    mockSessionManager,
    mockFileTransferHandler,
    mockCalibrationCaptureManager,
    mockJsonSocketClient,
    mockNetworkConfiguration,
    mockLogger
)
```

### 2. Build System Validation - ✅ VERIFIED

**Achievement**: Android application now builds successfully using Gradle build system:
```bash
./gradlew :AndroidApp:assembleDevDebug
# BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 23s
# 47 actionable tasks: 14 executed, 33 up-to-date
```

**Benefits:**
- Development workflow restored
- Continuous integration compatibility
- APK generation for testing and deployment
- Dependency resolution working correctly
