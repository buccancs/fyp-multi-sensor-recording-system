## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy implements a progressive validation approach that recognizes the diverse needs of different user groups while maintaining scientific rigor throughout. This methodology draws from both traditional software testing practices [31] and specialized approaches for scientific computing applications [32], creating a framework that supports both rapid development iteration and comprehensive research validation.

### Test Categories and Execution

#### 1. Quick Validation (30 seconds)

Quick validation serves as the foundation of our testing strategy, implementing the "shift-left" testing philosophy advocated in modern DevOps practices [33]. This approach provides immediate feedback on critical system functionality while minimizing the time investment required for basic confidence validation.

```bash
# Essential pre-flight checks
cd /home/runner/work/bucika_gsr/bucika_gsr/PythonApp
python run_quick_recording_session_test.py
```

This validation encompasses the most critical system components: Python application initialization validates that the desktop controller can establish its runtime environment and load essential configurations. Android device simulation ensures that the mobile component simulation framework is correctly configured and responsive. Socket communication establishment verifies that the network communication layer between PC and Android components is functional. Basic recording session workflow validation confirms that the core data collection pipeline can execute successfully from initiation through completion.

#### 2. Comprehensive Integration (15 minutes)

Comprehensive integration testing addresses the complex interactions between system components, following the integration testing strategies outlined in Myers' "The Art of Software Testing" [34]. This level of testing is essential for identifying interface issues and ensuring that individual components work effectively together.

```bash

Performance benchmarking follows established methodologies for performance testing in research applications [35], establishing baseline metrics and monitoring for performance regressions that could impact research quality. This approach recognizes that performance consistency is critical for research reproducibility.

```bash
# Performance validation and stress testing
python test_enhanced_stress_testing.py --performance-bench
python run_recording_session_test.py --devices 4 --duration 120 --performance-bench
```

**Performance Targets** are established based on empirical analysis of research requirements and system capabilities. Memory usage targeting less than 500MB during normal operation ensures that the system remains responsive even during extended data collection sessions. CPU utilization limits of 50% average during recording preserve system resources for other research applications that may run concurrently. Network throughput requirements exceeding 10Mbps minimum ensure adequate bandwidth for multi-device high-frequency sensor data collection. Response time thresholds under 500ms (95th percentile) maintain acceptable user experience according to established human-computer interaction guidelines [36].

#### 4. Security and Quality Assurance (20 minutes)

Security and quality assurance testing addresses the critical requirements of research environments where data integrity and system security are paramount. This approach follows NIST Cybersecurity Framework guidelines [37] and incorporates best practices for secure research computing environments [38].

High-intensity stress testing evaluates system behavior under maximum load conditions, validating that the system maintains data integrity and responsiveness even when operating at the limits of its design specifications. This testing approach is crucial for research applications where system failures could result in significant data loss or research delays.

```bash
python run_recording_session_test.py \
    --stress-test \
    --devices 8 \
    --duration 300 \
    --memory-stress
```

#### Network-Constrained Environment
