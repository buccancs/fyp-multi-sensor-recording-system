# Diagram Generation Summary

## Task Completed: Recreate PNG diagrams in docs/diagrams

### What was accomplished:

1. **Analyzed existing state:**
    - Found 17 existing PNG files (with gaps at 06, 10, 11)
    - Located comprehensive Mermaid source code in MERMAID_DIAGRAMS_IMPROVED.md
    - Identified need for high-quality diagram regeneration

2. **Set up generation environment:**
    - Installed @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli via npm
    - Configured Puppeteer for headless browser rendering
    - Created automated Python script for batch processing

3. **Generated high-quality diagrams:**
    - **14 existing diagrams regenerated** from Mermaid source code
    - **3 new diagrams created** to fill gaps (06, 10, 11):
        - 06: System Requirements Architecture
        - 10: Real-time Data Processing Pipeline
        - 11: Quality Assurance and Validation Framework

4. **Technical specifications:**
    - **Resolution:** 4K (4000x3000px) with 2x scale factor
    - **Format:** PNG with white background
    - **Theme:** Professional neutral theme with consistent color scheme
    - **File sizes:** Range from 204KB to 1.4MB
    - **Total files:** 17 complete diagrams (01-17, no gaps)
