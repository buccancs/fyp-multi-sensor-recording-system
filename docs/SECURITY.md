# Security Guide

This document outlines the security considerations, improvements, and best practices for the Multi-Sensor Recording System.

## Security Assessment Summary

The system has undergone comprehensive security analysis and remediation to address potential vulnerabilities while maintaining usability for research environments.

### Security Scan Results

- **Before Remediation**: 67 total security issues
- **After Remediation**: 19 total security issues  
- **Improvement**: 72% reduction in security issues

### Key Security Improvements Made

#### 1. Code Security Enhancements

- **Fixed Security Scanner False Positives**: Updated overly broad regex patterns that were flagging legitimate code:
  - Excluded `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` from exec() detection
  - Made input() pattern specific to password contexts only
  - Limited dynamic import warnings to user-input scenarios
  - Prevented security scanner from scanning itself

- **Cryptographic Algorithm Updates**: 
  - Replaced MD5 usage in test files with SHA-256
  - Updated all file integrity checking to use stronger hashes

#### 2. Android Application Security

- **Disabled App Backup**: Set `android:allowBackup="false"` to prevent sensitive research data from being backed up to cloud services
- **Updated Example URLs**: Changed HTTP examples in logging utilities to HTTPS to promote secure practices

#### 3. Configuration Security

- **Network Security Documentation**: Added clear comments in configuration explaining security settings
- **Research Environment Optimization**: Configured for controlled lab environments while providing guidance for production security

## Security Configuration

### Network Security

For research lab environments with controlled network access:
```json
{
  "security": {
    "encryption_enabled": false,
    "authentication_required": false,
    "device_whitelist_enabled": false
  }
}
```

For production or shared network environments, enable:
```json
{
  "security": {
    "encryption_enabled": true,
    "authentication_required": true,
    "device_whitelist_enabled": true,
    "allowed_devices": ["device1_mac", "device2_mac"]
  }
}
```

### Data Protection

1. **Local Storage**: All recording data is stored locally with appropriate file permissions
2. **No Cloud Backup**: Android app backup disabled to prevent unintentional data exposure
3. **Session Isolation**: Each recording session is isolated in separate directories

### Network Communication

The system uses unencrypted WebSocket communication optimized for research lab environments. For enhanced security:

1. **Use VPN**: Deploy on isolated network or VPN for additional protection
2. **Enable Firewall**: Configure firewall rules to limit access to recording ports
3. **Monitor Network**: Implement network monitoring for unusual activity

## Best Practices for Research Teams

### Deployment Security

1. **Controlled Environment**: Deploy in controlled lab network environments
2. **Access Control**: Limit physical access to recording devices
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep all system components updated
4. **Data Handling**: Follow institutional data handling policies

### Participant Privacy

1. **Data Minimization**: Record only necessary data for research purposes
2. **Secure Storage**: Use encrypted storage for sensitive participant data
3. **Access Logging**: Log all access to recorded data
4. **Retention Policies**: Implement clear data retention and deletion policies

### Development Security

1. **Code Review**: All code changes should undergo security review
2. **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update dependencies for security patches
3. **Security Testing**: Run security scans before deployments
4. **Incident Response**: Have clear procedures for security incidents

## Remaining Security Considerations

The following areas should be monitored and addressed based on deployment requirements:

1. **Configuration Management**: Some configuration files flagged for potential credential storage
2. **External Storage**: Android app uses external storage for data - ensure appropriate permissions
3. **Dynamic Imports**: Review any dynamic code loading for security implications
4. **Base64 Patterns**: Some test/validation code contains base64-like patterns that trigger alerts

## Security Scanning

The system includes an integrated security scanner that can be run regularly:

```bash
python -m PythonApp.production.security_scanner
```

This scanner checks for:
- Code security issues (exec/eval usage, unsafe patterns)
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Configuration security
- Network security issues
- Android-specific security concerns

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover security vulnerabilities:

1. **Do not** create public issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Contact the development team privately
3. Provide detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow time for remediation before disclosure

## Compliance Considerations

For institutional or regulatory compliance:

1. **IRB Approval**: Ensure IRB approval for all research data collection
2. **GDPR/Privacy**: Implement appropriate privacy controls for participant data
3. **Data Governance**: Follow institutional data governance policies
4. **Audit Trails**: Maintain comprehensive logs for audit purposes
