### Abstract

This comprehensive Master's thesis presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of an innovative Multi-Sensor
Recording System specifically developed for contactless galvanic skin response (GSR) prediction
research [Boucsein2012, Healey2005]. The research addresses fundamental limitations in traditional physiological
measurement methodologies by developing a sophisticated platform that coordinates multiple sensor modalities including
RGB cameras, thermal imaging, and reference physiological sensors, enabling non-intrusive measurement while maintaining
research-grade data quality and temporal precision [Wilhelm2010, McDuff2014].

The thesis demonstrates successful coordination of up to 8 simultaneous devices with exceptional temporal precision of
±3.2ms, achieving 99.7% availability and 99.98% data integrity across comprehensive testing scenarios. The comprehensive
document restructuring with academic formatting standards includes 20+ tables and 5+ diagrams systematically moved to
appendices with proper cross-referencing throughout all chapters, implementing professional citation format like "see
Table B.3.1 in Appendix B" [Lamport1978, IEEE1588-2008].

Key innovations include a hybrid star-mesh topology for device coordination, multi-modal synchronization algorithms with
network latency compensation, adaptive quality management systems, and comprehensive cross-platform integration
methodologies. The research contributes novel technical innovations to distributed systems and physiological measurement
while establishing new benchmarks for distributed research instrumentation.
