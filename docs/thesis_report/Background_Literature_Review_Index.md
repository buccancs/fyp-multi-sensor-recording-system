## ðŸŽ¯ Key Contributions and Academic Foundations

### Physiological Measurement Foundation
The comprehensive analysis establishes the scientific rationale for multi-modal physiological stress detection, providing detailed examination of:
- **Autonomic nervous system responses** and their measurement through GSR and thermal imaging
- **HPA axis activation** and cortisol as a complementary stress biomarker
- **Temporal dynamics** of different stress response systems and their measurement implications

### Technology Selection Rationale
Systematic justification for sensor platform choices based on:
- **Research-grade measurement capabilities** balanced with practical deployment considerations
- **Multi-modal integration requirements** for synchronized data collection
- **Community adoption and long-term sustainability** factors

### Machine Learning Integration Hypothesis
Framework for combining RGB and thermal imaging modalities through:
- **Complementary information content** analysis
- **Multi-modal fusion strategies** using deep learning approaches
- **Performance comparison frameworks** for validating multi-modal advantages
