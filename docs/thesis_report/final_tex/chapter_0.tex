 \begin{abstract}

This thesis presents a multi-sensor recording system designed for
contactless Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) prediction research.

The system integrates multiple sensing modalities including thermal imaging, RGB
cameras, and environmental sensors to enable non-intrusive stress monitoring.

The work addresses fundamental challenges in physiological computing by developing a
robust, offline-first recording platform that supports distributed sensor networks
and real-time data synchronization.

Key contributions include: (1) a distributed recording architecture supporting
multiple sensor types, (2) contactless GSR prediction algorithms utilizing computer
vision and thermal analysis, (3) thorough validation studies comparing contactless
predictions with traditional contact-based measurements, and (4) open-source
implementation enabling reproducible research in physiological computing.

The system demonstrates significant potential for applications in human-computer
interaction, health monitoring, and stress assessment while maintaining user comfort
and ecological validity through non-intrusive measurement approaches.
