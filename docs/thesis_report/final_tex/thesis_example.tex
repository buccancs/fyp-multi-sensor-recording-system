% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
This thesis presents a comprehensive multi-sensor recording system designed for contactless Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) prediction research. The system integrates multiple sensing modalities including thermal imaging, RGB cameras, and environmental sensors to enable non-intrusive stress monitoring. The work addresses fundamental challenges in physiological computing by developing a robust, offline-first recording platform that supports distributed sensor networks and real-time data synchronization.

Key contributions include: (1) a distributed recording architecture supporting multiple sensor types, (2) contactless GSR prediction algorithms utilizing computer vision and thermal analysis, (3) comprehensive validation studies comparing contactless predictions with traditional contact-based measurements, and (4) open-source implementation enabling reproducible research in physiological computing.

The system demonstrates significant potential for applications in human-computer interaction, health monitoring, and stress assessment while maintaining user comfort and ecological validity through completely non-intrusive measurement approaches.

\chapter*{Compilation Instructions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Compilation Instructions}

To compile this thesis document:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ensure all \texttt{.tex} files and \texttt{references.bib} are in the same directory
\item Run the following commands in sequence:
\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex thesis_example.tex
bibtex thesis_example
pdflatex thesis_example.tex
pdflatex thesis_example.tex
\end{verbatim}
\item The final PDF will be generated as \texttt{thesis\_example.pdf}
\end{enumerate}

Alternative compilation using \texttt{latexmk}:
\begin{verbatim}
latexmk -pdf thesis_example.tex
\end{verbatim}

This will automatically handle the multiple compilation passes required for proper bibliography and cross-reference generation.
