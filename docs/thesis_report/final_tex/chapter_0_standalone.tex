\chapter{Chapter 0: Abstract}

\begin{abstract}
This thesis presents a complete multi-sensor recording system designed for contactless Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) prediction research. The system integrates multiple sensing modalities, including thermal imaging, RGB cameras, and environmental sensors, to enable non-intrusive stress monitoring. The work addresses fundamental challenges in physiological computing by developing a robust, offline-first recording platform that supports distributed sensor networks and real-time data synchronisation.

Key contributions include: (1) a distributed recording architecture supporting multiple sensor types, (2) contactless GSR prediction algorithms utilising computer vision and thermal analysis, (3) thorough validation studies comparing contactless predictions with traditional contact-based measurements, and (4) open-source implementation enabling reproducible research in physiological computing.

The system demonstrates significant potential for applications in human-computer interaction, health monitoring, and stress assessment while maintaining user comfort and ecological validity through completely non-intrusive measurement approaches.
