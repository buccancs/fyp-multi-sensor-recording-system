## 1.1 Background and Motivation

### Research Context and Scientific Foundations

The field of physiological measurement has undergone significant transformation over the past decades, driven by advances in sensor technologies, computational capabilities, and our understanding of human psychophysiology. Traditional physiological measurement approaches, while scientifically validated and widely adopted, impose inherent limitations that constrain research design and may influence the very phenomena being studied.

Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), also known as Electrodermal Activity (EDA), represents one of the most established methods for measuring physiological arousal and stress responses in research settings. This biomarker has been extensively validated across decades of psychophysiological research and remains a gold standard for measuring sympathetic nervous system activation [CITE - Boucsein, W. (2012). Electrodermal activity. Springer Science & Business Media].

However, the contact-based nature of traditional GSR measurement introduces several methodological constraints that limit its applicability in naturalistic research settings. The requirement for electrode placement creates physical constraints on participant movement, introduces potential discomfort that may alter baseline physiological responses, and restricts experimental designs to controlled laboratory environments.

### Evolution of Physiological Measurement Technologies

The progression of physiological measurement technologies reflects the broader evolution of sensor systems and computational analysis capabilities. Early physiological measurement systems required specialized laboratory equipment, trained operators, and controlled environmental conditions to achieve reliable measurements. These systems, while accurate, were primarily suited for clinical and laboratory research applications.

The emergence of wearable sensor technologies represents a significant advancement in making physiological measurement more accessible and less intrusive. Consumer-grade wearable devices have democratized access to basic physiological monitoring capabilities, enabling continuous measurement in natural environments. However, these devices often sacrifice measurement precision for convenience and may not meet the accuracy requirements for rigorous scientific research.

Recent advances in computer vision, thermal imaging, and signal processing have opened new possibilities for contactless physiological measurement. These approaches leverage remote sensing technologies to extract physiological signals without requiring direct contact with participants, potentially eliminating many limitations of traditional measurement approaches while maintaining research-grade accuracy.

### Limitations of Current Approaches

Traditional contact-based physiological measurement approaches, while scientifically validated, present several fundamental limitations that constrain research applications:

**Physical Constraints and Participant Comfort**: Electrode placement for GSR measurement requires direct skin contact and may cause discomfort during extended recording sessions. The physical presence of electrodes can restrict natural movement and may influence participant behavior, potentially introducing artifacts into the data being collected.

**Environmental Restrictions**: Traditional measurement systems typically require controlled laboratory environments with specialized equipment and trained operators. This constraint limits the applicability of physiological measurement to naturalistic settings where authentic behavioral responses might be observed.

**Scalability Limitations**: Contact-based measurement approaches face practical limitations when scaling to multiple participants or large-scale studies. Each participant requires individual sensor attachment, calibration, and monitoring, creating logistical challenges for research designs requiring simultaneous measurement of multiple individuals.

**Measurement Artifacts**: The process of electrode attachment and the physical presence of measurement equipment may alter the baseline physiological state being measured. This fundamental challenge, known as the "observer effect," can influence the validity of measurements, particularly in stress and emotion research where the measurement process itself may induce stress responses.

### Motivation for Contactless Measurement Paradigms

The development of contactless physiological measurement approaches addresses these limitations while preserving the scientific rigor required for research applications. Contactless measurement enables:

**Naturalistic Measurement Environments**: By eliminating the need for direct contact, participants can be measured in natural settings without the constraints imposed by traditional measurement equipment. This capability enables research into authentic behavioral responses that may not be observable in controlled laboratory environments.

**Multi-Participant Coordination**: Contactless approaches enable simultaneous measurement of multiple participants without the logistical complexity of individual sensor attachment and calibration. This capability opens new possibilities for research into group dynamics, social interaction, and collective physiological responses.

**Longitudinal and Continuous Monitoring**: The reduced intrusiveness of contactless measurement enables extended monitoring periods without participant discomfort or measurement artifacts. This capability supports longitudinal research designs and the study of physiological patterns over extended time periods.

**Ethical and Practical Advantages**: Contactless measurement reduces the invasiveness of research participation while maintaining measurement quality. This approach may increase participant recruitment and retention while reducing ethical considerations associated with invasive measurement procedures.

## 2.1 Problem Context and Significance

### Problem Context and Significance

The central research problem addressed in this thesis emerges from the intersection of several technological and methodological challenges in physiological measurement research. While contact-based GSR measurement provides established and validated physiological data, the constraints it imposes on research design and participant experience limit its applicability for many contemporary research questions.

**Research Design Constraints**: Traditional physiological measurement approaches restrict experimental designs to controlled laboratory settings with stationary participants. This limitation prevents the study of physiological responses in naturalistic environments where authentic behavioral patterns might emerge. Many research questions in psychology, human-computer interaction, and behavioral science require measurement capabilities that preserve ecological validity while maintaining measurement precision.

**Technological Integration Challenges**: Existing contactless measurement approaches typically focus on single-modality sensing and lack the comprehensive integration required for research-grade applications. The challenge lies in coordinating multiple sensor modalities (RGB cameras, thermal imaging, reference physiological sensors) with the temporal precision and data quality required for scientific research while maintaining the practical usability needed for routine research operations.

**Validation and Reliability Requirements**: Any alternative to established measurement approaches must demonstrate comparable accuracy and reliability while providing clear advantages in terms of usability and research design flexibility. The challenge is developing contactless measurement capabilities that meet scientific standards for validity and reliability while offering practical advantages over traditional approaches.

**Scalability and Accessibility Considerations**: Research instrumentation often requires specialized equipment, technical expertise, and significant financial investment that may limit accessibility for many research teams. The challenge is developing approaches that democratize access to advanced physiological measurement capabilities while maintaining research-grade quality and scientific validity.
