\section{Testing Methodology}

The Multi-Sensor Recording System underwent comprehensive testing to validate its performance against the requirements specified in Chapter 3. The testing approach encompassed multiple levels: unit testing of individual components, integration testing of subsystem interactions, and system-level validation of end-to-end functionality.

\subsection{Test Strategy}

The testing strategy followed a systematic approach addressing both functional and non-functional requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Unit Testing}: Individual components tested in isolation using automated test suites
\item \textbf{Integration Testing}: Subsystem interactions validated through controlled scenarios
\item \textbf{System Testing}: End-to-end functionality tested in realistic usage scenarios
\item \textbf{Performance Testing}: Temporal synchronisation accuracy and throughput measurements
\item \textbf{Reliability Testing}: Extended operation and fault tolerance validation
\item \textbf{Usability Testing}: User experience evaluation with researchers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Environment}

Testing was conducted in a controlled laboratory environment with the following configuration:

\begin{itemize}
\item PC Controller: Intel i7-10700K, 32GB RAM, Windows 10
\item Android Devices: Samsung Galaxy S10 and Pixel 4a running Android 11
\item Network: Dedicated 5GHz WiFi network with <20ms latency
\item Sensors: Shimmer3 GSR+ units, Topdon TC001 thermal cameras

Key performance metrics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Recording start synchronisation: ±1.2ms across devices
\item Recording stop coordination: ±0.8ms across devices
\item Data completeness: 99.97\% across all test sessions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Time Synchronisation (FR3)}

Temporal synchronisation accuracy was measured using precision timing equipment and cross-correlation analysis of shared events across data streams.

Synchronisation performance results:
\begin{itemize}
\item Median synchronisation error: ±2.1ms
\item 95th percentile error: ±4.2ms
\item Clock drift over 60 minutes: <0.1ms/minute

\item Memory usage remained stable at 1.1-1.2GB over extended operation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scalability Testing}

Multi-device scalability was validated by progressively increasing the number of connected Android devices and monitoring system performance:

\begin{itemize}
\item 2 devices: 100\% performance, <1ms additional latency
