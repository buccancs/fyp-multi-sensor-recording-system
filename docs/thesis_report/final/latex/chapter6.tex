\section{Limitations and Critical Assessment}

\subsection{Technical Limitations}

While the system achieves its primary objectives, several technical limitations must be acknowledged:

\textbf{Environmental Sensitivity}: The thermal imaging component is sensitive to ambient temperature variations and requires controlled environmental conditions for optimal performance. Temperature fluctuations of ±2°C can affect baseline measurements, limiting deployment in uncontrolled environments.

\textbf{Individual Variability}: GSR responses exhibit significant individual differences, with 5-10\% of participants showing minimal responses to standard stimuli. This variability challenges the development of generalizable prediction models and may require subject-specific calibration approaches.

\textbf{Motion Artifacts}: While accelerometer-based motion detection helps identify artifacts, significant head or body movement still affects both thermal and RGB data quality. This limitation restricts the system's applicability in dynamic or mobile scenarios.

\textbf{Network Dependency}: The distributed architecture requires reliable network connectivity for synchronisation and control. Network latency variations can impact synchronisation accuracy, though the system maintains performance within acceptable bounds for typical laboratory networks.

\subsection{Methodological Limitations}

\textbf{Laboratory-Centric Design}: The current system is optimised for controlled laboratory environments. Adaptation for field studies or naturalistic settings would require additional engineering to address environmental variability and setup complexity.

\textbf{Limited Stress Induction Protocols}: Validation focused on standardised laboratory stress tasks (Stroop tests, TSST protocols). The system's performance with naturalistic stress events or other emotional states remains to be validated.

\textbf{Single-Session Validation}: Current validation primarily consists of single-session recordings. Long-term stability and reproducibility across multiple sessions with the same participants requires further investigation.

\subsection{Scope Limitations}

\textbf{Predictive Model Development}: This thesis focused on the data collection infrastructure rather than developing the machine learning models for GSR prediction. The actual contactless prediction capability remains to be demonstrated through future work.

\textbf{Clinical Validation}: While the system captures research-grade physiological data, clinical validation for healthcare applications is beyond the current scope and would require additional regulatory consideration and validation studies.

\textbf{Scalability Testing}: While the system supports up to 4 devices simultaneously, larger-scale deployment scenarios have not been thoroughly evaluated.
