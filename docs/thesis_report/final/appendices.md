## Appendix E: Evaluation Data -- Supplemental Evaluation Data and Analyses

Appendix E provides additional **evaluation data and analyses** that
supplement the testing results, focusing on the system's performance in
practical and research contexts. This includes user experience
evaluations, comparative analyses with conventional methods, and any
statistical analyses performed on collected data.

**User Experience Evaluation:** Since the system is intended for use by
researchers (potentially non-developers), usability is crucial.
Appendix E summarises feedback from trial uses by researchers and
technicians. Using standardised metrics like the System Usability Scale
(SUS) and custom questionnaires, the system's interface and workflow
were rated very highly. In fact, user feedback indicated a notably high
satisfaction score -- approximately **4.9 out of 5.0** on average for
overall system
usability[\[47\]](docs/thesis_report/Chapter_7_Appendices.md#L110-L111).
Participants in the evaluation noted that the setup process was
straightforward and the integrated UI (desktop + mobile) made conducting
sessions easier than expected. Key advantages cited were the minimal
need for manual synchronisation and the clear real-time indicators
(which helped users trust the data quality). Appendix E includes a
breakdown of the usability survey results, showing high scores in
categories like "ease of setup," "learnability," and "efficiency in
operation." Any constructive feedback (for example, desires for more
automated analysis or minor UI improvements) is also documented to
inform future work.

**Scientific Validation:** A critical part of evaluating this system is
determining if the **contactless GSR measurements correlate well with
traditional contact-based measurements**. Thus, the appendix presents
data from side-by-side comparisons. In a controlled study, subjects were
measured with the contactless system (thermal camera + video for remote
GSR prediction) as well as a conventional GSR sensor. The resulting
signals were analysed for correlation and agreement. The analysis found
a **high correlation (≈97.8%)** between the contactless-derived
physiological signals and the reference
signals[\[42\]](docs/thesis_report/Chapter_7_Appendices.md#L8-L11).
In practical terms, this means the system's predictions of GSR (via
multimodal sensors and algorithms) closely match the true galvanic skin
response obtained from traditional electrodes, validating the scientific
viability of the approach. Additionally, other physiological metrics
(like heart rate, which the system can estimate from video) were
validated: e.g. heart rate estimates had negligible error compared to
pulse oximeter readings.

**Performance vs. Traditional Methods:** Appendix E also provides an
evaluative comparison highlighting the benefits gained by this system.
It establishes that the contactless system maintains **measurement
accuracy comparable to traditional methods** while eliminating physical
contact
constraints[\[48\]](docs/README.md#L152-L160).
For instance, the timing precision of events in the data was on par with
wired systems (sub-5 ms differences), and no significant data loss or
degradation was observed compared to a wired setup. The document may
include tables or charts -- for example, comparing stress level
indicators derived from the thermal camera (via physiological signal
processing) against cortisol levels or GSR peaks from standard
equipment, showing the system's measures track well with established
indicators (supporting the research hypotheses).

**Statistical Analysis:** Where applicable, the appendix presents
statistical analyses supporting the evaluation. This could include
significance testing (demonstrating that the system's measurements are
not significantly different from traditional measurements in a sample of
participants), and reproducibility analysis (the system yields
consistent results across repeated trials, with low variance). For
usability, a summary of qualitative comments and any measured reduction
in setup time or errors is given. Indeed, one outcome noted was a **58%
reduction in technical support needs** during experiments, thanks to the
system's automation and
reliability[\[49\]](docs/thesis_report/Chapter_7_Appendices.md#L38-L45).
Researchers could conduct more sessions with fewer interruptions,
suggesting a positive impact on research productivity.

In summary, Appendix E consolidates the evidence that the Multi-Sensor
Recording System is not only technically sound (as per Appendix D) but
also effective and efficient in a real research environment. The
supplemental evaluation data underscore that the system meets its
ultimate goals: enabling high-quality, contactless physiological data
collection with ease of use and scientific integrity.

## Appendix F: Code Listings -- Selected Code Excerpts (Synchronisation, Data Pipeline, Integration)

This appendix provides key excerpts from the source code to illustrate
how critical aspects of the system are implemented. The following
listings highlight the synchronisation mechanism, data processing
pipeline, and sensor integration logic, with inline commentary:

**1. Synchronisation (Master Clock Coordination):** The code below is
from the `MasterClockSynchronizer` class in the Python controller. It
starts an NTP time server and the PC server (for network messages) and
launches a background thread to continually monitor sync status. This
ensures all connected devices share a common clock reference. If either
server fails to start, it handles the error
gracefully[\[50\]](PythonApp/master_clock_synchronizer.py#L86-L94)[\[51\]](PythonApp/master_clock_synchronizer.py#L95-L102):

`python try: logger.info("Starting master clock synchronisation system...") if not self.ntp_server.start(): logger.error("Failed to start NTP server") return False if not self.pc_server.start(): logger.error("Failed to start PC server") self.ntp_server.stop() return False self.is_running = True self.master_start_time = time.time() self.sync_thread = threading.Thread( target=self._sync_monitoring_loop, name="SyncMonitor" ) self.sync_thread.daemon = True self.sync_thread.start() logger.info("Master clock synchronisation system started successfully")`[\[52\]](PythonApp/master_clock_synchronizer.py#L86-L102)

In this snippet, after starting the NTP and PC servers, the system
spawns a thread (`SyncMonitor`) that continuously checks and maintains
synchronisation. Each Android device periodically syncs with the PC's
NTP server, and the PC broadcasts timing commands. When a recording
session starts, the `MasterClockSynchronizer` sends a **start command
with a master timestamp** to all devices, ensuring they begin recording
at the same synchronised
moment[\[53\]](PythonApp/master_clock_synchronizer.py#L164-L172).
This design achieves tightly coupled timing across devices, which is
crucial for data alignment.

**2. Data Pipeline (Physiological Signal Processing):** The system
processes multi-modal sensor data in real-time. Below is an excerpt from
the data pipeline module (`cv_preprocessing_pipeline.py`) that computes
heart rate from an optical blood volume pulse signal (e.g. from face
video). It uses a Fourier transform (Welch's method) to find the
dominant frequency corresponding to heart
rate[\[54\]](PythonApp/webcam/cv_preprocessing_pipeline.py#L72-L80):

```python
# Inside PhysiologicalSignal.get_heart_rate_estimate()

freqs, psd = scipy.signal.welch( self.signal_data,
fs=self.sampling_rate, nperseg=min(512, len(self.signal_data) // 4), )
hr_mask = (freqs \>= freq_range\[0\]) & (freqs \<= freq_range\[1\])
hr_freqs = freqs\[hr_mask\] hr_psd = psd\[hr_mask\] if len(hr_psd) \> 0:
peak_freq = hr_freqs\[np.argmax(hr_psd)\] heart_rate_bpm = peak_freq \*
60.0 return heart_rate_bpm
\`\`\`[\[54\]](PythonApp/webcam/cv_preprocessing_pipeline.py#L72-L80)

This code takes a segment of the physiological signal (for example, an
rPPG waveform extracted from the video) and computes its power spectral
density. It then identifies the peak frequency within a plausible heart
rate range (0.7--4.0 Hz, i.e. 42--240 bpm) and converts it to beats per
minute. The data pipeline includes multiple such processing steps: ROI
detection in video frames, signal filtering, feature extraction, etc.
These are all implemented using efficient libraries (OpenCV, NumPy,
SciPy) and run in real-time on the captured data streams. The resulting
metrics (heart rate, GSR features, etc.) are timestamped and stored
along with raw data for later analysis. This code excerpt exemplifies
the kind of real-time analysis the system performs on sensor data to
enable contactless physiological monitoring.

**3. Integration (Sensor and Device Integration Logic):** The system
integrates heterogeneous devices (Android phones, thermal cameras,
Shimmer GSR sensors) into one coordinated framework. The following code
excerpt from the `ShimmerManager` class (Python controller) shows how an
Android-integrated Shimmer sensor is initialised and
managed[\[55\]](PythonApp/shimmer_manager.py#L241-L249)[\[56\]](PythonApp/shimmer_manager.py#L250-L258):

`python if self.enable_android_integration: logger.info("Initialising Android device integration...") self.android_device_manager = AndroidDeviceManager( server_port=self.android_server_port, logger=self.logger ) self.android_device_manager.add_data_callback(self._on_android_shimmer_data) self.android_device_manager.add_status_callback(self._on_android_device_status) if not self.android_device_manager.initialise(): logger.error("Failed to initialise Android device manager") if not PYSHIMMER_AVAILABLE: return False else: logger.warning("Continuing with direct connections only") self.enable_android_integration = False else: logger.info(f"Android device server listening on port {self.android_server_port}")`[\[57\]](PythonApp/shimmer_manager.py#L241-L258)

This snippet demonstrates how the system handles sensor integration in a
flexible way. If Android-based integration is enabled, it spins up an
`AndroidDeviceManager` (which listens on a port for Android devices'
connections). It registers callbacks to receive sensor data and status
updates from the Android side (e.g., the Shimmer sensor data that the
phone relays). When initialising, if the Android channel fails (for
instance, if the phone app is not responding), the code falls back: if a
direct USB/Bluetooth method (`PyShimmer`) is available, it will use that
instead (or otherwise run in simulation
mode)[\[56\]](PythonApp/shimmer_manager.py#L250-L258).
In essence, the integration code supports *multiple operational modes*:
direct PC-to-sensor connection, Android-mediated wireless connection, or
a hybrid of
both[\[58\]](PythonApp/shimmer_manager.py#L134-L143).
The system can discover devices via Bluetooth or via the Android app,
and will coordinate data streaming from whichever path is
active[\[59\]](PythonApp/shimmer_manager.py#L269-L278)[\[60\]](PythonApp/shimmer_manager.py#L280-L289).
Additional code (not shown here) in the `ShimmerManager` handles the
live data stream, timestamp synchronisation of sensor samples, and error
recovery (reconnecting a sensor if the link is
lost)[\[61\]](PythonApp/shimmer_manager.py#L145-L151).

Through these code excerpts, Appendix F illustrates the implementation
of the system's key features. The synchronisation code shows how strict
timing is achieved programmatically; the data pipeline code reveals the
real-time analysis capabilities; and the integration code highlights the
system's versatility in accommodating different hardware configurations.
Each excerpt is drawn directly from the project's source code,
reflecting the production-ready, well-documented nature of the
implementation. The full source files include further comments and
structure, which are referenced in earlier appendices for those seeking
more in-depth understanding of the codebase.
