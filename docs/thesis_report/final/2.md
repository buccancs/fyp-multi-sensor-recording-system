# Chapter 2. Background and Literature Review

## 2.1 Emotion Analysis Applications

Emotion analysis -- the automated detection of human emotional states --
has broad applications across psychology, human-computer interaction,
healthcare, and other fields. In **affective computing**, researchers
leverage physiological signals to recognize emotions and improve user
interfaces or social robots [10]. For example, **galvanic skin response

(GSR)** and related biosignals are commonly used to gauge emotional
arousal in lab studies and real-world monitoring. GSR data can reveal
how subjects react to stimuli even when self-reports are biased, making
it valuable in areas like *stress and anxiety studies*, *user experience
testing*, and *neuromarketing* [3]. In psychological research, changes
in skin conductance have been analyzed to understand anxiety during
therapy or excitement during gameplay [3]. In **human-computer

interaction (HCI)**, measuring unconscious physiological responses (e.g.
via GSR, heart rate, facial cues) helps evaluate user stress or
engagement with software interfaces [3]. Even in critical domains such
as driver monitoring and workplace safety, detecting stress or fatigue
through physiological signals is being explored to prevent accidents.

Multi-modal emotion recognition systems often combine signals -- e.g.
facial expressions (from video) with physiological sensors -- to improve
robustness. Visible behaviours alone can be masked or voluntarily
controlled, whereas internal signals like GSR or heart rate reflect
involuntary arousal [1]. This has motivated the integration of
**wearable sensors** and **imaging** for richer emotion analysis. This
work follows this trend: the system employs a wearable GSR sensor alongside
camera-based thermal imaging to capture both external and internal
indicators of stress. By collecting synchronised video, thermal, and
biosensor data, the platform caters to emerging applications that
require **contactless yet reliable emotion sensing** -- for instance,
continuous stress monitoring in everyday environments or adaptive
systems that respond to a user's hidden emotional state. Such a
multi-modal approach can enhance detection accuracy and provide insight
into the physiological underpinnings of emotional reactions.

## 2.2 Rationale for Contactless Physiological Measurement

Traditional methods of measuring physiological signals often rely on
contact sensors (electrodes, chest straps, finger clips, etc.), which,
while accurate, can be obtrusive. For example, capturing GSR
conventionally requires attaching electrodes to the fingers or palm, and
measuring stress hormones requires drawing blood or saliva. These
intrusive methods may interfere with natural behaviour and are
impractical for continuous real-life monitoring [1]. In contrast,
**contactless measurement** uses remote sensors like cameras to gauge
physiological changes without direct skin contact. The rationale for
pursuing contactless techniques is twofold: **improved comfort and
ecological validity**, and **broader deployment potential**.

From a research perspective, non-intrusive monitoring helps preserve the
subject's natural physiological response. Wearing electrodes or being
tethered to instruments can itself induce stress or discomfort,
potentially confounding the very signals under study [1]. By using
cameras (thermal or optical) at a distance, one can monitor heart rate,
facial temperature, respiration, or other stress markers while the
person remains unencumbered. This approach is especially valuable in
settings like psychotherapy sessions, classrooms, or daily work
environments where attaching sensors would be impractical. Researchers
have explicitly called for **contactless alternatives** to common
wearables, noting that camera-based methods could capture autonomic
responses without the need for electrodes or wires [5].

The second advantage is scalability and convenience. Camera-based
physiological monitoring can leverage ubiquitous devices (smartphones,
CCTV, laptop cameras), enabling stress detection in the wild. For
instance, recent work has shown that a simple smartphone camera
(recording a person's face or fingertip) can extract heart rate via
photoplethysmography, and a compact thermal camera can capture
stress-induced temperature changes[3]. Such approaches open the door
to **ambient stress sensing** -- imagine vehicles or smart rooms that
assess occupants' stress without requiring wearables. Moreover, in
scenarios like public health screening or large-scale studies,
contactless methods allow rapid measurements while maintaining hygiene
and physical distancing. This proved especially pertinent during the
COVID-19 pandemic, where contact-free vital sign measurement gained
interest.

In the context of GSR prediction, the goal is to **infer stress-related
GSR levels without the GSR sensor**. Achieving this requires collecting
data from a contact sensor (for ground truth) in parallel with
contactless surrogates, then training models to predict the former from
the latter. The motivation is that if GSR can be reliably predicted from,
say, thermal imaging and RGB video, future stress monitoring could
eliminate the need for a physically attached galvanic sensor. Overall,
the pursuit of contactless physiological measurement aligns with making
stress and emotion monitoring more **natural, scalable, and
user-friendly**, which is why the platform emphasises integrating a
thermal camera and other non-contact modalities alongside the
traditional sensors.

## 2.3 Definitions of \"Stress\" (Scientific vs. Colloquial)

The term "stress" carries distinct meanings in scientific literature
versus everyday language. In colloquial use, *stress* often refers to a
subjective feeling of pressure, anxiety, or being overwhelmed. People
say they are "stressed out" referring to psychological strain or
emotional tension. In scientific terms, however, stress is defined more
broadly as the body's **physiological and psychological response to any
demand or challenge**. Hans Selye famously defined stress as "the
nonspecific result of any demand upon the body, whether mental or
somatic"[4]. This definition frames stress as an **adaptive response**
by the organism, encompassing a wide range of stimuli (stressors) and
responses, not all of which are negative. Scientifically, stress
involves activation of neural and endocrine pathways (notably the
sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal
axis) that mobilise the body to cope with perceived challenges.

A key distinction is that colloquial usage nearly always implies
*distress* -- an undesirable state of worry or nervousness -- whereas
scientific discourse recognises that not all stress is harmful. Selye
introduced terms like *eustress* (positive, beneficial stress) and
*distress* (negative, harmful stress)[8]. For example, excitement
before a competition might be considered eustress (heightened arousal
that can improve performance), in contrast to chronic anxiety which is
distress. In daily language, this nuance is often lost, as any intense
pressure tends to be labeled simply as "stress." Another difference lies
in perspective: colloquially one might say "this job is causing me
stress," focusing on external stressors, whereas scientifically this thesis distinguishes the *stressor* (e.g. job demands) from the *stress response*
(the person's physiological reaction).

It is important in a study about stress to clarify definitions, since
the goal is to measure and predict a person's **stress state**. In this
thesis, stress is aligned with the scientific view: stress is treated as a
psychophysiological state arising from certain demands or challenges,
characterised by activation of specific biological systems. The thesis is
particularly concerned with the **acute stress response**, which
involves sympathetic nervous system arousal ("fight-or-flight") and the
release of stress hormones. This response can be triggered by both
negative and positive stimuli (fear, workload, excitement, etc.), so
mere detection of arousal (e.g. via GSR) does not tell us if the person
is "stressed" in the everyday sense of anxious or upset. Throughout this
work, elevated GSR or cortisol are interpreted as indicators of
*physiological stress arousal*, which typically correlates with what
people consider stress but still requires context. In sum, *scientific
stress* refers to a measurable response of the organism (which can be
neutral or even beneficial in moderation), whereas *colloquial stress*
usually denotes an excessive or unpleasant psychological state[4].
Bridging this gap is part of the challenge in stress monitoring: the aim is
to predict and ultimately detect when someone's physiological signals
suggest they are under strain likely to be perceived as "stress" in the
everyday sense.

## 2.4 Cortisol vs. GSR as Stress Indicators

When measuring stress, researchers often distinguish between **endocrine
indicators** and **electrodermal indicators**. *Cortisol*, a
glucocorticoid hormone released by the adrenal cortex, is widely
regarded as a *gold-standard* biochemical indicator of stress,
reflecting activation of the hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal (HPA)
axis[8]. *Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)*, also known as electrodermal
activity (EDA), is a peripheral measure of sympathetic nervous system
arousal (part of the "fight-or-flight" response) detectable as changes
in skin conductance. Both have been used extensively in stress research,
but they differ significantly in physiology, time course, and
practicality.

**Cortisol:** Upon a significant stressor, the HPA axis is engaged --
the hypothalamus and pituitary trigger cortisol release from the adrenal
glands. Cortisol's effects (raising blood sugar, suppressing
non-essential functions) prepare the body to handle a prolonged
challenge. A hallmark of cortisol is its *delayed peak*: cortisol levels
rise gradually, typically peaking about 20--30 minutes after the onset
of an acute stressor[7]. For example, a sudden fright or mental
challenge will elicit immediate nervous system responses, but the
maximum cortisol concentration in saliva or blood occurs roughly half an
hour later as part of the recovery/adaptation phase. Additionally,
cortisol is usually measured through analysis of saliva, blood, or hair
samples. These methods, while accurate, are **intrusive or slow** --
requiring sampling and laboratory assays -- making them impractical for
real-time or continuous monitoring[11]. Despite these challenges,
cortisol provides a *direct index of HPA-axis activity* and is
invaluable for validating other stress measures. It is often considered
a ground truth for chronic or cumulative stress load and is sensitive to
factors like circadian rhythm (e.g. the cortisol awakening response each
morning).

**GSR (Electrodermal Activity):** In contrast, GSR reflects *sympathetic
nervous system (SNS) activation* and can change within seconds of a
stressor. Psychological or physical stress leads to an immediate surge
in sympathetic signals, causing sweat glands (especially on palms and
soles) to secrete moisture. Even before visible perspiration, this sweat
increases the skin's electrical conductance. Thus, a GSR sensor can
detect a spike often **within 1--5 seconds** of a stimulus -- far faster
than cortisol changes[7]. GSR is essentially measuring one facet of
the "fight-or-flight" response: the eccrine sweat gland activation that
accompanies arousal. Because of this, skin conductance peaks are tightly
coupled with moments of surprise, anxiety, or effort. *Each GSR peak can
be thought of as the footprint of a sympathetic arousal event*,
typically followed by a rise in cortisol 20--30 minutes later[7].
Researchers have leveraged this relationship -- for example, using
patterns of GSR peaks to predict impending cortisol elevations in stress
experiments[7]. Unlike cortisol, measuring GSR is non-invasive and
continuous: a pair of electrodes on the skin can stream data in real
time. Modern wearable devices make it relatively easy to log GSR over
hours or days.

**Indicator Comparison:** Both cortisol and GSR are valid stress
indicators, but they tap into different arms of the stress response.
Cortisol is a **hormonal indicator** (HPA axis) with a slow, sustained
response, useful for assessing total stress exposure and recovery over
tens of minutes to hours[7]. GSR is a **neuronal indicator**
(sympathetic SAM axis) with an immediate, phasic response, useful for
detecting brief arousal events and moment-to-moment intensity. Cortisol
is specific to stress in that large increases (beyond normal diurnal
variation) usually imply a significant stressor; however, cortisol
measurement is costly and cannot easily distinguish multiple short
stress incidents from one prolonged event without frequent sampling.
GSR, by contrast, is extremely responsive but *not specific to stress
per se* -- any stimulus that triggers arousal (startle, pain,
excitement, cognitive effort, etc.) will produce a GSR change[12].
Thus, context is required to interpret GSR: one typically combines it
with known experimental conditions or other signals to infer "stress" as
opposed to general arousal.

Another practical difference is data quality and ease of measurement.
Cortisol assessment requires trained personnel and lab equipment;
salivary cortisol, for instance, involves participants drooling into
tubes and then lab immunoassays or mass spectrometry. The delay in
obtaining results (hours or days) means cortisol cannot provide
real-time feedback. GSR sensors, on the other hand, are inexpensive and
offer immediate data, but are susceptible to noise (e.g. motion
artifacts or temperature effects on the skin). Moreover, while cortisol
readings are scalar values at specific sample times, GSR is a continuous
waveform requiring interpretation (e.g. tonic level vs. phasic peaks).
Despite these differences, studies frequently observe that GSR and
cortisol correlate under certain stress paradigms -- acute stressors
that cause a clear cortisol rise also tend to evoke increased skin
conductance, though the correlation is far from perfect[7]. This
underlines that they measure related but distinct aspects of the stress
response.

In summary, cortisol and GSR serve complementary roles in stress
research. Cortisol is a **direct chemical marker** of stress with high
specificity but poor timeliness, whereas GSR is an **immediate
electrical marker** of arousal with excellent temporal resolution but
lower specificity. This project focuses on GSR as the target for
prediction due to its real-time nature -- the envisioned system
could eventually estimate "what would the person's GSR be now" from
contactless signals. However, understanding cortisol's behaviour is
important for broader context, and one could extend this work by also
predicting cortisol levels from non-invasive signals. Notably, one
recent study modeled cortisol responses by convolving skin conductance
peaks, effectively estimating cortisol from GSR[7]. This reinforces
the tight coupling of the two measures: the fast SNS-mediated GSR and
the slower HPA-mediated cortisol are successive waves of the integrated
stress response.

## 2.5 GSR Physiology and Measurement Limitations

**Physiology of GSR:** Galvanic Skin Response is grounded in the
physiology of sweat glands and skin conductance. The human skin,
especially on the palms and fingers, is densely populated with *eccrine
sweat glands* (on the order of 2--3 million glands over the body, with
high density on palms, fingers, and soles)[13]. These glands are
innervated solely by the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous
system. When the sympathetic nervous system activates (due to emotional
arousal, cognitive effort, thermoregulation, etc.), it triggers these
glands to produce sweat -- even in the absence of overt sweating,
microscopic changes occur. Sweat is rich in water and electrolytes; as
it fills the ducts and moistens the skin surface, it alters the
electrical properties of the skin. Specifically, the presence of sweat
*lowers the skin's electrical resistance* and thus *raises its
conductance*. GSR refers to measuring this change: a small voltage or
current is applied across two points on the skin, and the conductance
(or its reciprocal, resistance) is recorded. **Emotional arousal leads
to distinctive GSR patterns**: for instance, a sudden startle or mental
stress can cause a sharp increase in skin conductance -- a *skin
conductance response* (SCR) -- superimposed on a slowly shifting
baseline level (*skin conductance level*, SCL)[13][14].

These patterns are easily observed -- even a subtle stimulus like an
exciting image or a deep breath can produce a visible deflection in a
high-resolution GSR signal. Because these changes are not under
conscious control (one cannot easily suppress or fake them), GSR is
regarded as a pure measure of *autonomic arousal*[15].
Physiologically, the mechanism can be summarized as: **emotional
sweating** causes ionic changes that increase skin conductance[16].
The palmar and plantar surfaces (hands and feet) are most commonly used
because they exhibit the largest and most reliable conductance changes
linked to psychological stimuli[13]. (Historically, this is why the
polygraph "lie detector" often measures palm GSR -- lying is presumed to
induce a stress response detectable as sweaty palms.) The GSR signal
thus directly reflects sympathetic nervous system activity. It does not
tell us *why* the SNS is activated -- only that it is. However, in
controlled experiments or context-specific applications, GSR peaks are
highly informative. For example, in a stress test, an increase in GSR
correlates with moments of perceived challenge or surprise. In
fear-conditioning research, conditioned stimuli elicit SCRs as an index
of learned fear response.

**Measurement Limitations:** Despite its usefulness, GSR comes with
several considerations and limitations:

- **Non-specificity of Arousal:** As noted, GSR measures arousal, not
  valence or specific emotion. A high GSR could mean stress or fear, but
  equally could indicate excitement or surprise. Context (or additional
  signals) is needed to interpret the meaning of a GSR change[12].
  Thus, using GSR alone to infer "stress" can be problematic unless the
  scenario is well-defined. In this work, the system pairs GSR with known
  stressors or user-reported stress to ensure the GSR changes are indeed
  stress-related. Machine learning models may also incorporate other
  modalities (like facial expression or heart rate) to help disambiguate
  the cause of arousal.

- **Inter- and Intra-person Variability:** Skin conductance responses
  vary widely between individuals, and even within an individual over
  time. Some people (so-called *non-responders*) exhibit very low GSR
  reactivity, perhaps due to skin properties or autonomic differences.
  Others have high tonic levels or exaggerated responses. Factors like
  skin dryness, hydration, and even personality traits can affect GSR
  amplitude. Within the same person, factors such as time of day, skin
  temperature, and fatigue can change the baseline conductivity. This
  variability means that often one must use relative changes or
  individual calibration rather than absolute GSR values when comparing
  stress levels across people.

- **Environmental Factors:** GSR data can be influenced by the
  environment. Ambient temperature and humidity affect how quickly sweat
  evaporates and the skin's natural moisture. A hot environment might
  raise baseline skin moisture (increasing conductance) even without
  psychological arousal; a cold, dry environment might suppress or delay
  GSR responses. Similarly, if a person is physically active (raising
  body temperature and sweating for thermoregulation), it can confound
  the GSR that is supposed to reflect psychological factors. Researchers
  must control or at least record these variables. For instance,
  maintaining a consistent room temperature and ensuring the participant
  is at rest before measurement helps[12]. In the platform, the system logs
  environmental conditions and incorporate calibration periods to
  establish baseline conductance.

- **Motion Artifacts and Contact Issues:** Because GSR electrodes are
  usually attached to fingers with gel or straps, movement can introduce
  artifacts. Even slight finger movements can change contact pressure or
  create electrical noise. Good practice is to secure electrodes firmly
  and ask participants to minimise hand movement. Still, artifact
  removal algorithms (detecting rapid, implausible spikes) are often
  needed. The system addresses this by including an accelerometer
  channel from the Shimmer sensor to detect motion that can be used to
  flag affected data segments[1]. Contact quality is another issue:
  if electrodes dry out or are not well attached, the signal can drift
  or drop out. Regularly checking electrode adhesion and using
  conductive gel can mitigate this.

- **Slow Recovery and Habituation:** After a significant SCR, it takes
  time for skin conductance to return to baseline (on the order of tens
  of seconds). If stressors occur in rapid succession, the signals can
  overlap. Moreover, people habituate -- repeated exposure to the same
  stimulus yields smaller GSR responses over time as the novelty wears
  off. This must be considered in experimental design: one should allow
  enough time between stimuli or use analysis methods (e.g. deconvolving
  overlapping SCRs) to address this.

- **Units and Calibration:** GSR can be reported either as conductance
  (often in microsiemens, μS) or resistance (kilohms). The Shimmer3 GSR+
  device, for example, measures skin resistance in kΩ and can internally
  convert to conductance[8]. Calibration to absolute units can be
  tricky because skin conductance has no fixed zero -- even dry skin has
  some conductance. Many researchers use relative change (ΔμS) or
  standard scores. Nonetheless, for the predictive modeling it is
  helpful to work in consistent units (the system uses μS), so the calibration
  Shimmer output accordingly.

Despite these limitations, GSR remains one of the most sensitive and
convenient measures of emotional arousal[14]. Its drawbacks can be
managed through careful design and data processing. In the context of
this thesis, GSR provides the ground truth "stress signal" the aim is to
predict using other sensors. the system leverages the Shimmer GSR sensor's high
resolution (16-bit data at 128 Hz sampling[8]) to capture
fine-grained electrodermal dynamics. At the same time, the implementation includes
strategies like baseline normalization, synchronisation with other
channels, and artifact filtering to ensure the GSR data is reliable. By
acknowledging GSR's limitations, this approach -- especially the
integration of additional modalities like thermal imaging -- is designed
to compensate for them (for instance, using thermal cues to help
identify true stress responses versus environmental sweating).

## 2.6 Thermal Cues of Stress in Humans

Beyond "cold sweat" and heart palpitations, stress manifests in subtle
thermal changes on the human body. **Infrared thermography** provides a
way to observe these changes: it measures the heat emitted from the
skin, revealing patterns of blood flow and perspiration that are
invisible to the naked eye. *Skin temperature* is a known physiological
correlate of autonomic activity -- changes in emotional or mental state
can cause measurable shifts in facial and peripheral skin
temperature[10]. Under stress, the autonomic nervous system alters both
**vasomotor tone** (blood vessel diameter) and **sudomotor activity**
(sweating), each of which has thermal consequences[10][5].
Vasoconstriction in surface vessels tends to *cool the skin* in those
areas, while increased blood flow (vasodilation) *warms the skin*.
Meanwhile, evaporative cooling from sweat can locally reduce skin
temperature (hence the term "cold sweat")[5]. These physiological
adjustments form a complex thermal signature of stress.

Researchers have identified several characteristic thermal cues
associated with acute stress or fear. One of the most replicated
findings is a drop in temperature at the tip of the nose (and sometimes
the cheeks) during a startle or mental stress task[10][5]. The nose,
being highly vascular and exposed, is particularly sensitive to
stress-driven vasoconstriction. In one study with an acute psychological
stressor (Stroop test), the nose was the only facial region whose
temperature changed significantly -- *specifically, it cooled under
stress* compared to baseline[10]. This nose-tip cooling is on the order
of 0.1°C to 0.5°C, detectable with a high-sensitivity thermal camera.
The mechanism is thought to be that under stress, blood is shunted from
the periphery (nose, ears, fingers) to deeper tissues (a primitive
response to prepare for injury or conserve core heat), combined with
possible evaporative cooling from subtle sweat. Another well-known
thermal sign is around the eyes: the periorbital region (inner eye area
and forehead) often *warms up* during stress. This is attributed to
increased blood flow in the supraorbital region as part of the
fight-or-flight response, and the relative insulation of that area (less
exposed than the nose). Some thermal imaging studies of fear or startle
have observed an increase in temperature around the eyes simultaneous
with a nose temperature drop[10][5]. Essentially, the face shows a
pattern of cooling in some regions and warming in others, reflecting
this redistribution of blood.

Beyond the face, stress can cause cooling of the extremities (hands,
fingers) due to vasoconstriction. Thermographic studies of stress in
hands (e.g. during a public speaking task) have found that fingertip
temperature can decrease when a person is anxious -- consistent with the
classic anxiety symptom of "cold, clammy hands." Thermal cameras have
even been used to detect deception or fear by monitoring facial
temperature changes. For example, one experiment showed that when
subjects were startled or lying, the temperature of the cheeks and
forehead increased (flushing) but the nose temperature dropped markedly
-- a pattern dubbed the "Pinocchio effect" in thermal
imaging[10][14].

Importantly, thermal cues of stress are **contactless** and involuntary,
making them attractive for monitoring. A person cannot easily control
their skin blood flow or where they radiate heat. However, interpreting
these cues requires careful analysis because many factors influence skin
temperature. Ambient temperature and airflow can change absolute skin
readings. Physical activity or posture changes can also alter
circulation. Thus, stress-related thermal changes are often extracted by
looking at *relative changes* in specific regions or by using algorithms
that correlate thermal data with known autonomic signals. For example,
one approach is to track the temperature of the nose over time and look
for sudden drops that coincide with stressors or high GSR readings. In
the platform, the system records thermal video of the face and aim to derive
features (like nose tip temperature or the gradient between inner eye
and nose) that correlate with stress events.

Recent research has applied advanced analyses to thermal data to
quantify these responses. One study combined thermal imaging with heart
rate variability and GSR, and found through cross-mapping analysis that
facial skin temperature dynamics were significantly coupled with those
autonomic measures under stress[10][5]. They confirmed the
**"well-known decrease in nose temperature"** during acute stress and
linked it quantitatively to both increased electrodermal activity and
shifts in cardiac autonomic balance[5]. Another line of work involves
measuring the thermal signature of breathing: under stress, breathing
patterns can change (often becoming faster or shallower), and this is
detectable as changes in the temperature of exhaled air around the
nostrils. Thermal cameras can capture this by the cyclical warming and
cooling near the nose as one breathes; irregular or rapid breathing
under stress is thus another thermal cue[1]. In fact, one system by
Murthy *et al.* used a thermal camera to monitor respiration rate and
could classify high vs. low stress levels with good accuracy based on
breathing changes alone[1].

In summary, human stress leaves a **thermal fingerprint**: a
constellation of temperature shifts (nose cooling, possible forehead
warming, peripheral cooling, altered breathing heat patterns) that can
be measured remotely. These changes are subtle (fractions of a degree)
but detectable with modern thermal sensors that have sensitivities
\<0.1°C. By leveraging these cues, thermal imaging offers a unique
window into the physiological stress response. It essentially visualizes
some of the same processes that GSR and heart rate indicate --
sympathetic activation and its effects -- but in a 2D spatial manner
across the skin. In this thesis, thermal cues form a crucial part of the
multi-modal data. The hypothesis is that by feeding these thermal features
into a predictive model, the detection and prediction of
stress (as reflected in GSR) beyond what traditional cameras or
single-modality sensors could achieve.

## 2.7 RGB vs. Thermal Imaging for Stress Detection (Machine Learning Hypothesis)

Given the capabilities described, an important question arises: **How
does traditional RGB video compare to thermal imaging for detecting
stress, and can combining them improve machine learning predictions?**
This section outlines the rationale and hypothesis guiding the use of
both an RGB camera (visible spectrum) and a thermal camera.

**RGB Video (Visible Light Imaging):** A normal camera captures facial
expressions, body movements, and skin colour changes in the visible
spectrum. These can carry stress information. For instance, facial
expression analysis might detect a furrowed brow or frown associated
with stress or concentration. Skin colour changes -- though minute --
can also reveal physiology: a technique known as **remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG)** uses a regular camera to detect slight
pulsatile changes in skin colouration due to blood flow. From rPPG, one
can derive heart rate and heart rate variability, which are known stress
correlates (e.g. stress typically elevates heart rate and reduces HRV).
Indeed, **Cho et al. (2019)** combined a smartphone's RGB camera (for
rPPG) with a thermal camera for stress monitoring, achieving about
**78.3% accuracy** in binary stress classification[1]. RGB cameras are
also high resolution and capture identity and context -- e.g. who the
person is, what their posture is, and environmental context (are they at
a computer, in traffic, etc.). This contextual information could
indirectly help predict stress (for example, seeing that someone is in a
noisy crowd vs. a quiet room). Crucially, RGB imaging is *passive in
terms of physiology* -- it observes external cues that might be
voluntarily controlled or masked. A person might smile to hide stress or
remain expressionless, and normal video could then miss the internal
turmoil.

**Thermal Imaging:** Thermal cameras, as discussed, directly capture
*physiological signatures* such as skin temperature distribution and
breathing patterns. They do not see facial expressions in the
traditional sense (a smile and a grimace might look similar in pure
temperature terms if muscle movements do not alter blood flow). Instead,
they pick up on things like the warmth of blood in the face, sweat
evaporation cooling the skin, and the heat of exhaled air. Thermal
imaging is largely insensitive to lighting conditions and works in
darkness, which is an advantage over RGB when light is limited. It also
sees through certain obscurants like light fog (though not glass), which
is why thermal is used in night vision and surveillance[15]. For
stress detection, the key advantage is that **thermal focuses on
involuntary physiological changes** that a person cannot easily hide or
fake. Even if someone maintains a poker face, a thermal camera might
catch their nose cooling or their breathing becoming rapid. On the
downside, thermal cameras have much lower resolution (the device is
256×192 pixels[Topdon Technology(2024a)], compared to a typical RGB video of 1920×1080 or
higher). They also lack colour or texture information -- everything is a
temperature reading -- which means they will not capture certain stress
cues like trembling (unless it causes temperature fluctuation) or facial
flushing that does not significantly change heat emission. Additionally,
thermal images of different people look more similar than RGB images
(thermal ignores features like skin pigment or hair colour), so
identifying individuals or analysing facial expressions is harder.

**Hypothesis -- Complementary Strengths:** The hypothesis is that **thermal
imaging will provide complementary information to RGB, leading to better
stress (GSR) prediction than RGB alone**. In other words, a model with
access to both visible facial cues and thermal physiological cues should
outperform a model with only one modality. Thermal can pick up subtle
autonomic cues, while RGB can capture behavioural cues and provide
context for alignment. Prior studies support this idea. For example, in
a controlled experiment, Cho et al. (2019) used a FLIR One thermal
camera attached to a smartphone along with the phone's regular camera to
classify mental stress. By analysing the nose-tip temperature from
thermal and the blood volume pulse from the RGB camera, they achieved
\~**78% accuracy**, comparable to state-of-the-art methods with much
more equipment[1]. This shows that combining thermal and visual
physiological signals is feasible and effective. In another study,
**Basu et al. (2020)** fused features from thermal and visible facial
images to recognise emotional states, using a blood perfusion model on
the thermal data. The fused model reached **87.9% accuracy**,
significantly higher than using visible images alone[1]. Such results
suggest that thermal data adds discriminative power. Researchers have
noted that thermal imaging can capture stress-related changes
non-intrusively and is a promising solution for affective
computing[16]. Moreover, unlike purely vision-based methods on RGB
(which often rely on facial expressions that can be deliberately
controlled), thermal provides a more objective measure of inner
state[1].

**Considerations:** There are practical considerations in using both
modalities. Aligning thermal and RGB images is non-trivial, since they
are different spectra and resolutions -- calibration and software image
registration are needed. The system tackles this with calibration
procedures (e.g. using an Android calibration routine and OpenCV) to
align the two camera views[1]. There is also the issue of data
volume: combining two video streams increases data size and model
complexity. However, modern deep learning methods and precise time
synchronisation make this manageable. The design includes a
synchronisation engine that timestamps frames from both the RGB and
thermal cameras to within 1 ms, ensuring data streams can be fused
accurately in time[1].

We also hypothesize that **under certain conditions thermal may
outperform RGB alone for stress detection**. For instance, in darkness
or when a person maintains a neutral expression, an RGB-based approach
might fail, while thermal would still catch physiological changes.
Conversely, in scenarios where stress is primarily manifest in behaviour
(e.g. fidgeting or facial grimaces) but physiological changes are
subtle, RGB might contribute more. Thus, using both modalities provides
broader coverage. Our machine learning models can learn to weigh
features from each modality -- potentially finding that, say, a slight
nose temperature drop combined with a forced smile is a strong indicator
of stress, whereas either alone might be ambiguous.

In summary, **RGB vs. Thermal is not an either/or proposition but a
complementary one**. We expect thermal imaging to reveal the
*involuntary thermal signatures of stress* while RGB provides the
*contextual and behavioral cues*. The platform collects both
synchronously, and the hypothesis is that using both in a predictive
model will yield the best results for predicting GSR (as a proxy of
stress). This approach aligns with the trend in affective computing to
use **multimodal data** -- leveraging multiple sensor types to capture

## 2.8 Sensor Device Selection Rationale (Shimmer GSR Sensor and Topdon Thermal Camera)

To implement the multi-modal platform described, hardware components were carefully selected
that balance **signal quality**, **integration
capability**, and **practical considerations**. In particular, the design chose
the **Shimmer3 GSR+** wearable sensor for electrodermal activity
measurement and the **Topdon TC-series** thermal camera for infrared
imaging, alongside a standard smartphone camera for RGB video. This
section explains why these devices were chosen over alternatives, and
how their characteristics support the system's goals.

**Shimmer3 GSR+ Sensor:** The Shimmer3 GSR+ is a research-grade wireless
sensor designed specifically for capturing GSR (EDA) along with other
signals like photoplethysmography (PPG) and motion. Several key factors
motivated this choice:

- *High-Quality GSR Data:* The Shimmer GSR+ provides a high sampling
  rate and resolution for GSR. It samples at **128 Hz with 16-bit
  resolution** on the GSR channel[8], which is well above the minimum
  needed to capture fast SCR dynamics. The wide measurement range (10 kΩ
  to 4.7 MΩ skin resistance) covers the full spectrum of likely skin
  conductance values[8]. This ensures that both very small responses
  and large sweats are recorded without clipping. Many cheaper GSR
  devices (e.g. those in fitness wearables) sample at lower rates or
  with 8--10 bit ADCs, potentially missing subtle features. Shimmer's
  data quality is evidenced by its common use in academic research and
  validation studies.

- *Multi-Channel Capability:* Although GSR is the primary interest, the
  Shimmer3 GSR+ includes additional sensing channels -- notably a PPG
  channel (for heart rate) sampled at 128 Hz, and an inertial sensor
  package (accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.)[17]. These extra channels
  add value: the PPG can be used to derive heart rate and heart rate
  variability, providing another stress indicator alongside GSR[17].
  The accelerometer/gyro can be used to detect motion artifacts or
  estimate activity level. Instead of needing separate devices for these
  signals, the Shimmer offers them in one unit, time-synchronised. In
  the implementation, the accelerometer is enabled to log motion, which
  helps in data cleaning (e.g. if a participant moves suddenly and a GSR
  spike occurs, motion can be attributed as the cause). Having all these streams
  time-aligned from one device simplifies data integration.

- *Bluetooth Wireless Connectivity:* The Shimmer connects via Bluetooth,
  transmitting data in real time to a host (PC or smartphone). This
  wireless operation was crucial for the use case -- it allows the
  participant to move naturally without being tethered, and it enables
  the sensor data to be synchronised easily with other mobile devices
  (like an Android phone running the cameras). The Shimmer's Bluetooth
  interface is supported by an official API. In the system architecture,
  a **Shimmer Manager** module on the PC (and optionally on Android)
  handles connecting to the Shimmer and streaming its data[17]. We
  enabled the Bluetooth interface to integrate Shimmer data seamlessly
  into the multi-device recording sessions. The alternative, a wired GSR
  device, would limit movement and complicate simultaneous recording
  with cameras.

- *Open SDK and Integration:* Shimmer provides open-source APIs (for
  Java/Android and for Python/C++) which allowed us to integrate the
  sensor without reverse-engineering proprietary formats. the system leveragesd
  the **Shimmer Java Android API** on the mobile side and a PyShimmer
  library on the PC side[15]. This saved significant development time.
  For example, the Android app includes a `ShimmerRecorder` component
  that interfaces with the Shimmer over Bluetooth and streams data into
  the recording session[17]. The PC controller includes a
  `ShimmerManager` that can manage multiple Shimmer devices and
  coordinate their data with incoming camera data[17]. Using the
  official Shimmer libraries (developed by Shimmer's engineers) proved
  more reliable than trying to use a generic BLE interface or a
  custom-built GSR device.

- *Validated Performance:* The Shimmer3 GSR+ has been validated in prior
  studies, which gave us confidence in its accuracy. Its measurement
  technique (constant voltage across two electrodes to measure skin
  resistance) and internal calibration are documented in the literature,
  meaning the results can be compared with other research using Shimmer.
  This is preferable to using a novel or untested GSR device where
  independent validation of outputs would be required. Additionally, the
  Shimmer is safe and comfortable (it uses very low excitation currents
  for GSR to avoid any sensation). Given that participants might wear it
  for extended sessions, a well-designed, lightweight (\~22 g) device is
  important[8].

- *Alternatives Considered:* We considered devices like the **Empatica
  E4** wristband, which measures GSR, PPG, and motion. While the E4 is
  convenient (worn on the wrist), it has a much lower GSR sampling rate
  (\~4 Hz) and provides only processed, cloud-synced GSR data, making
  real-time integration difficult. Other custom-built options (e.g.
  Arduino-based GSR sensors) lacked the precision and would have
  required solving wireless and data sync challenges ourselves. Given
  these trade-offs, Shimmer was the clear choice for high-quality data
  and integration capabilities.

**Topdon Thermal Camera (TC Series):** For the thermal imaging
component, the selection was made a **Topdon** USB thermal camera (specifically the
*Topdon TC001* model, a smartphone-compatible IR camera) over other
thermal camera options. Several reasons justify this:

- *Smartphone Integration:* The Topdon camera is designed to plug into
  an Android smartphone via USB-C and comes with an Android SDK. This
  aligns perfectly with the system architecture: the design wanted the thermal
  camera to be part of a mobile setup, leveraged by an Android app.
  Using a smartphone-based thermal camera means the system can use the phone's
  processing power to handle image capture (and even some preliminary
  processing), and it simplifies participant setup (just attach the
  small camera to the phone). In contrast, many high-end thermal cameras
  (e.g. FLIR A65 or T-series) are standalone devices requiring a PC
  connection (via Ethernet/USB) and a dedicated power source -- not
  portable for the needs. The Topdon essentially turns the phone into a
  thermal imaging device.

- *Resolution and Frame Rate:* The Topdon TC camera offers a **thermal
  sensor resolution of 256×192 pixels** with a frame rate up to
  25 Hz[18]. This is a higher resolution than older consumer thermal
  cameras like the FLIR One (160×120) or Seek Thermal (206×156). While
  still lower than expensive scientific cameras (which can be 640×480 or
  more), 256×192 provides sufficient detail for facial thermal analysis
  -- one can discern features like the forehead, eyes, nose, etc. in the
  thermogram. The 25 Hz frame rate is near-video rate, which allows
  capturing dynamic changes and aligning frames reasonably well with the
  30 FPS RGB video. Our `ThermalRecorder` module fixes the thermal
  camera to 25 FPS, which proved to be a good balance between temporal
  resolution and data size[Topdon Technology(2024a)]. (Many lower-cost thermal devices cap
  at 9 Hz due to export regulations, but Topdon has clearance for 25 Hz
  -- a big plus for smooth signal monitoring.)

- *Radiometric Data Access:* Importantly, the Topdon SDK provides
  **radiometric data** -- meaning the system can retrieve the actual temperature
  reading for each pixel, not just a false-colour image. In the
  implementation, the system configures the camera to output both the thermal
  image and a temperature matrix for each frame[9][19]. The
  `ThermalRecorder` splits the incoming frame bytes into an image buffer
  and a temperature buffer, so the system records a raw thermal matrix (with
  calibrated temperature values per pixel) alongside the visual
  representation[19]. This quantitative data is crucial for analysis
  (the system can measure, say, that the nose is at 33.1 °C and dropped to
  32.5 °C). Some consumer cameras only give a colour-mapped thermal
  image without easy access to raw values, but Topdon's software allows
  full access. Having the **image + temperature mode** enabled[Topdon Technology(2024a)]
  means the dataset contains pixel-level temperature time series, which
  is ideal for training machine learning models to pick up subtle
  variations.

- *Cost and Availability:* The Topdon camera is relatively affordable
  (on the order of a few hundred USD) and commercially available. This
  made it feasible to acquire and deploy for this project. High-end
  scientific thermal cameras like the FLIR A65 can cost an order of
  magnitude more and are far less portable. We needed a device that a
  small research lab's budget could accommodate, potentially even
  multiple units for multi-subject data collection. Additionally, using
  a widely available consumer device aligns with the vision of future
  applications -- if stress can be inferred via a camera that any modern
  smartphone can host, it increases real-world applicability. Topdon, as
  a newer entrant in the thermal market, provided a sweet spot of
  performance and cost that matched the requirements (evaluation was conducted
  the FLIR One Pro, but its lower resolution and some SDK limitations
  made Topdon more attractive).

- *SDK and Support:* The Topdon came with an **InfiSense IRUVC SDK** (as
  seen in the code imports like `com.infisense.iruvc.*`)[2], which
  was crucial for rapid integration. Through this SDK, the system controls camera
  settings (emissivity, temperature range, etc.) and handle USB
  permissions and streaming in the Android app[5]. The SDK supports
  pulling frames via a callback -- the system uses an `IFrameCallback` interface
  to get each frame's byte data in real time[6]. Without such SDK
  support, integrating a raw thermal feed into the app would have been
  prohibitively difficult (some other cameras have only PC drivers). We
  also considered devices like the FLIR One Pro; while FLIR has an SDK,
  it is more restrictive and sometimes requires licensing. The
  Topdon/Infisense SDK was straightforward and had no licensing
  roadblocks. Our `ThermalRecorder` class was built around this SDK and
  runs stable recordings, including tasks like requesting USB permission
  from the user and handling device attach/detach events at
  runtime[7][20].

- *synchronisation and System Fit:* By using the Topdon with an Android
  phone, the system leverages the phone's internal clock to timestamp frames. The
  PC controller and phone are synchronised via Network Time Protocol
  (NTP) to ensure all data streams (GSR, thermal frames, RGB frames) can
  be aligned post-hoc with sub-millisecond precision[17]. When
  connected to the PC, the phone streams timestamped thermal data in
  real time via a WebSocket. This distributed architecture (a PC plus
  one or more Android devices) was designed with this hardware setup in
  mind[17]. The PC acts as a master coordinating multiple Android
  units (each potentially running a Topdon and phone camera). The
  *star-mesh topology* of the system means each Android device is
  relatively self-contained in sensing capability[17]. The Topdon
  fulfilled the role of giving each Android node a powerful sensing
  modality (thermal) with minimal additional hardware (just a tiny
  camera module on the phone). The devices also work well together in
  practice: both are small and non-invasive, allowing a participant to
  be recorded in a natural posture (the Shimmer sensor is typically worn
  on the wrist or arm with leads to the fingers, and the Topdon camera
  is lightweight and attached to the phone near the face). Data from
  both are streamed live, and the software can inject synchronisation
  signals if needed -- for example, the PC can send a command to flash
  the phone screen or toggle an LED as a sync marker, and log that event
  in both data streams[21].
