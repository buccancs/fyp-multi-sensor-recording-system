# Best Practices Evolution Framework

This document outlines our systematic approach to evaluating, adopting, and integrating new best practices and technologies in the Multi-Sensor Recording System. As the software development landscape evolves, this framework ensures we remain current while maintaining our high quality standards.

## Philosophy

Our approach to evolving best practices is:

- **Evidence-Based**: Adopt practices supported by research and proven results
- **Gradual**: Implement changes incrementally to minimize risk
- **Quality-First**: Ensure new practices improve rather than compromise quality
- **Research-Compatible**: Maintain alignment with academic research requirements

## Evaluation Framework

### Technology Assessment Matrix

When evaluating new technologies or practices, we use a comprehensive assessment matrix:

| Criteria | Weight | Scoring (1-5) | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Quality Impact** | 25% | | Impact on code quality, reliability, maintainability |
| **Research Alignment** | 20% | | Compatibility with research requirements and academic standards |
| **Team Expertise** | 15% | | Team's ability to adopt and maintain the technology |
| **Community Support** | 15% | | Ecosystem maturity, documentation, long-term viability |
| **Integration Effort** | 10% | | Effort required to integrate with existing systems |
| **Performance Impact** | 10% | | Effect on system performance and resource usage |
| **Security Implications** | 5% | | Security benefits or risks introduced |

### Evaluation Process

#### 1. Initial Assessment (Week 1)
