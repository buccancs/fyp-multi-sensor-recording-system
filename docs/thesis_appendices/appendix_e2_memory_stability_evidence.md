# Appendix E.2: Memory Stability and Endurance Testing Evidence

## Overview

This appendix provides evidence for the memory stability claims in Chapter 5, supporting statements about the absence of memory leaks during 8-hour endurance testing.

## Test Configuration

- **Test Duration:** 8 hours
- **Sampling Interval:** Every minute
- **Baseline Memory:** 866.4 MB
- **Leak Threshold:** 100 MB growth

## Results

- **Peak Memory Usage:** 870.9 MB
- **Maximum Growth:** 4.5 MB
- **Leak Warnings:** 0
- **Memory Stable:** Yes

## Analysis

The endurance test demonstrates that the system maintains stable memory usage over extended operation periods. Memory growth remained well below the leak detection threshold of 100 MB.

## Evidence File

Detailed memory usage data over the entire test period is available in:
`results/appendix_evidence/memory_stability_8hour_20250811_012938.csv`

This file contains timestamped memory measurements that can be used to generate memory usage plots for the thesis.

**Citation Reference:** Reference as "Appendix E.2 shows memory usage remained stable throughout the 8-hour test with no leak warnings."
