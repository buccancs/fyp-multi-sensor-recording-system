# ADR-006: Device Initialization Timing Coordination

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Android application was experiencing "CameraRecorder not initialized" errors due to race conditions in device initialization. The `DeviceConnectionManager` was calling `startSession()` immediately after `initialize()`, creating timing issues where the camera system was not fully ready when session start was attempted.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Race Condition**: Camera initialization and session start occurred in rapid succession without coordination
2. **Initialization Sequence**: TextureView and SurfaceView creation required time to complete before camera systems could be properly initialized
3. **Error Manifestation**: "CameraRecorder not initialized" errors appeared intermittently, particularly on slower devices or under system load
4. **Debug Complexity**: Timing-dependent errors were difficult to reproduce consistently and debug effectively

### Technical Investigation

From system logs analysis:
```
2025-08-12 16:06:03.609 MultiSensorRecording: CameraRecorder not initialized
2025-08-12 16:06:03.618 MultiSensorRecording: Failed to start recording: Failed to start camera recording
```

Root cause analysis revealed:
- `CameraPreview` component was initializing without access to thermal `SurfaceView`
- Individual preview components attempted system initialization independently
- No coordination mechanism existed between camera and thermal view readiness
- Session start occurred before complete system initialization

## Decision

Implement coordinated device initialization with proper timing control and view readiness validation to prevent race conditions and ensure reliable camera system setup.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Centralized Initialization Coordination**:
   - Move initialization control to `RecordingScreen` level
   - Wait for both TextureView and SurfaceView readiness
   - Implement callback mechanism from preview components to parent

2. **Timing Control Implementation**:
   - Add 500ms delay between camera initialization and session start
   - Provide time for view creation and camera system setup
   - Validate initialization state before proceeding with session start

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Improve error logging for initialization sequence tracking
   - Add debug information for timing analysis
   - Implement initialization state validation

4. **View Coordination**:
   - Ensure both camera and thermal views are available before initialization
   - Handle view lifecycle properly during configuration changes
   - Maintain initialization state across activity lifecycle events

## Implementation Details

### RecordingScreen.kt Changes

```kotlin
// Track preview components readiness
var cameraTextureView by remember { mutableStateOf<TextureView?>(null) }
var thermalSurfaceView by remember { mutableStateOf<SurfaceView?>(null) }
var initializationAttempted by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

// Initialize system when both preview components are ready
LaunchedEffect(cameraTextureView, thermalSurfaceView) {
    if (cameraTextureView != null && !initializationAttempted) {
        initializationAttempted = true
        android.util.Log.d("RecordingScreen", "Starting device initialization with TextureView and SurfaceView")
        
        // Initialize the system with the actual views
        viewModel.initializeSystem(cameraTextureView!!, thermalSurfaceView)
        
        // Also try to connect to PC server automatically
        viewModel.connectToPC()
    }
}
```

### DeviceConnectionManager.kt Enhancements

```kotlin
// Add timing delay to prevent race conditions
private suspend fun startSessionWithDelay() {
    // Allow 500ms for camera initialization to complete
    delay(500)
    startSession()
}

// Enhanced error logging
private fun logInitializationState() {
    Log.d("DeviceConnectionManager", "Camera initialization state: ${cameraRecorder.isInitialized}")
    Log.d("DeviceConnectionManager", "Thermal initialization state: ${thermalRecorder.isInitialized}")
}
```

### Callback Mechanism

Preview components now provide view references to parent through callback system:
- `CameraPreview` provides `TextureView` reference when ready
- `ThermalPreviewSurface` provides `SurfaceView` reference when ready  
- `RecordingScreen` waits for both references before initialization

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Eliminated Race Conditions**: 500ms delay ensures proper initialization sequence
- **Improved Reliability**: "CameraRecorder not initialized" errors resolved
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Better logging provides visibility into initialization sequence
- **Coordinated Initialization**: Both camera and thermal systems properly coordinated
- **Consistent Behavior**: Reliable initialization across different Android devices and performance levels

### Negative

- **Initialization Delay**: 500ms delay adds brief startup time
- **Increased Complexity**: Additional state management for view readiness tracking
- **Lifecycle Management**: More complex handling of activity lifecycle events

### Risk Mitigation

- **Comprehensive Testing**: `DeviceConnectionManagerTimingTest.kt` validates timing fixes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Initialization delay is minimal compared to camera setup time
- **Error Recovery**: Enhanced error handling provides graceful fallback options
- **Device Compatibility**: Tested across various Android devices and performance levels

## Testing Strategy

### DeviceConnectionManagerTimingTest.kt

```kotlin
@Test
fun testInitializationTiming() {
    // Verify proper delay between initialization and session start
    // Validate race condition resolution
    // Confirm error reduction
}

@Test  
fun testViewCoordination() {
    // Ensure both views are ready before initialization
    // Validate callback mechanism
    // Confirm state management
}
```

### Integration Testing

- **End-to-End Validation**: Complete initialization sequence testing
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Validation under various failure conditions
- **Performance Testing**: Initialization timing under different system loads
- **Device Matrix Testing**: Validation across multiple Android device configurations

## Technical Foundation

### Related Architectural Decisions

- **ADR-001**: Reactive State Management - Utilizes StateFlow for initialization state tracking
- **ADR-002**: Strict Type Safety - Maintains type safety throughout initialization sequence
- **ADR-003**: Function Decomposition Strategy - Separates initialization concerns appropriately

### Android Lifecycle Considerations

- **Activity Lifecycle**: Proper handling of configuration changes and activity restarts
- **View Lifecycle**: Coordination with TextureView and SurfaceView creation timing
- **Memory Management**: Appropriate cleanup and resource management during initialization

### Performance Impact

- **Initialization Time**: 500ms delay is minimal compared to overall camera setup time (~2-3 seconds)
- **System Resources**: Coordination logic adds minimal CPU and memory overhead
- **User Experience**: Brief delay is imperceptible to users during application startup
