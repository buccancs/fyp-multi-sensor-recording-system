## Documentation Standards and Compliance
All appendices follow the academic writing guidelines established for this project, maintaining:
- **Formal Academic Tone**: Objective, third-person perspective with precise technical terminology [1]
- **Comprehensive Referencing**: All claims supported with appropriate citations using numbered reference format
- **Ethics Compliance**: Full documentation of UCLIC Ethics Committee approval (Project ID: 1428) and GDPR compliance [3]
- **Reproducibility Standards**: Detailed technical specifications enabling system replication and validation
- **Quality Assurance**: Systematic documentation of testing methodologies and validation results
The modular documentation approach enables efficient navigation while maintaining academic rigour and supporting the thesis objectives of creating a deployable, research-grade system for contactless GSR prediction research.
