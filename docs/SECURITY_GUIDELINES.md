# Security Guidelines and Checklists
## Multi-Sensor Recording System

This document provides comprehensive security guidelines, checklists, and best practices for developers and contributors working on the Multi-Sensor Recording System.

## üîí Security Overview

The Multi-Sensor Recording System handles sensitive research data and requires robust security measures to protect participant privacy and ensure data integrity. This includes:

- **Research participant data protection**
- **Multi-device network communications**
- **Real-time sensor data streaming**
- **Cross-platform compatibility (Android/Python)**
- **GDPR compliance requirements**

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

### Core Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Privacy by Design**: Built-in privacy protection from the ground up
3. **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights and permissions
4. **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
5. **Encryption Everywhere**: End-to-end encryption for all data

### Security Components

- **TLS 1.3 Encryption**: All network communications
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Token Authentication**: Secure device authentication
- **Data Anonymization**: Automatic PII removal
- **Runtime Security Checks**: Startup validation
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection

## üîß Security Tools and Automation

### Automated Security Scanning

1. **Runtime Security Checker**
   ```python
   from PythonApp.production.runtime_security_checker import validate_runtime_security
   
   # Run at application startup
   validate_runtime_security()
   ```

2. **Dependency Scanner**
   ```bash
   python PythonApp/production/dependency_scanner.py
   ```

3. **Security Scanner**
   ```bash
   python PythonApp/production/security_scanner.py

Add to your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Security Scan
  run: |
    python -m bandit -r PythonApp/
    python -m safety scan
    python PythonApp/production/security_scanner.py
```

Configure `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit
    rev: '1.7.5'
    hooks:
      - id: bandit
        args: ['-r', 'PythonApp/']
