## Mermaid Best Practices Implementation

This updated diagram collection implements the following Mermaid documentation best practices:

**üéØ Design Principles Applied:**
1. **Clear and Descriptive Labels**: Each node includes descriptive text with bullet points for key features
2. **Logical Grouping**: Related components are grouped using subgraphs with meaningful titles
3. **Consistent Color Scheme**: Professional color palette applied consistently across all diagrams
4. **Appropriate Diagram Types**: Each concept uses the most suitable Mermaid diagram type
5. **Meaningful Connections**: Connection labels describe the relationship and data flow
6. **Visual Hierarchy**: Different styling for different component types and importance levels
7. **Professional Typography**: Enhanced font rendering and spacing for clarity

**üìè Technical Improvements:**
- **4K Resolution**: All diagrams now render at ultra-high resolution (3840+ pixel width)
- **Optimized Scaling**: 2x scale factor for crisp display on all devices
- **Enhanced Rendering**: Professional background colors and improved contrast
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified visual design language across all architectural views

## Architectural Principles

### Design Consistency
All diagrams consistently reference the established architecture principles:
- **PC master-controller** for centralized coordination
- **Offline-first local recording** for data integrity
- **JSON socket protocol** for standardized communication
- **Component-first design** for modularity and maintainability

### Visual Design
The diagrams feature:
- **Professional color scheme** with blue primary palette and complementary accent colors
- **Clear component hierarchy** with logical grouping and subgraphs
- **Consistent styling** across all diagram types
- **High-resolution rendering** suitable for documentation and presentations

### Academic Value
These visualizations support thesis documentation by providing:
- Clear, precise, and practical documentation style
- Component-first documentation approach explaining both rationale ("why") and implementation ("how")
- Professional visualization suitable for academic presentation
- Comprehensive system understanding for research purposes

## Usage Guidelines

### Documentation Integration
- Reference specific diagrams when explaining system components
- Use as visual aids during technical presentations
- Include in academic papers and thesis documentation
- Utilize for onboarding new team members

### Maintenance
- Update diagrams when architectural changes occur
- Maintain consistency with actual implementation
- Version control diagram sources alongside code changes
- Regular review for accuracy and completeness

## Technical Details

The diagrams are generated from mermaid.js source code with custom styling and rendered as high-resolution PNG images for optimal quality and compatibility across different platforms and documentation systems.

All diagrams maintain consistency with the established multi-sensor recording system architecture and provide both high-level overviews and detailed implementation insights.
