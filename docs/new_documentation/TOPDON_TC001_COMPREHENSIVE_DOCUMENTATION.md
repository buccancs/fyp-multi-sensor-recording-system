## 2. Hardware Architecture and Specifications

The hardware foundation of the TopDon TC001 and TC001 Plus cameras builds upon decades of advancement in uncooled microbolometer technology, representing a mature implementation of thermal sensing principles first established in military and aerospace applications (Kruse, 2001) [^7]. These devices incorporate sophisticated detector arrays, precision optical systems, and embedded processing capabilities that collectively enable high-quality thermal measurements in portable form factors suitable for research applications.

### 2.1 Thermal Sensor Technology

The core sensing element in both camera variants utilizes uncooled microbolometer technology, specifically implementing either vanadium oxide (VOx) or amorphous silicon (a-Si) microstructures arranged in a 256×192 focal plane array configuration. This detector architecture represents an optimal balance between spatial resolution, thermal sensitivity, and manufacturing cost-effectiveness for research-grade thermal imaging systems (Rogalski, 2019) [^1].

Each individual microbolometer element measures 12 μm × 12 μm, providing a total of 49,152 thermal pixels. The selection of this pixel pitch reflects careful optimization between several competing factors: smaller pixels would increase spatial resolution but reduce thermal sensitivity due to reduced collection area, while larger pixels would improve sensitivity at the cost of spatial detail (Wood, 1993) [^8]. The 12 μm dimension represents an industry-standard compromise that maintains excellent thermal sensitivity while providing sufficient spatial resolution for most research applications.

The microbolometer operation principle relies on the fundamental relationship between incident infrared radiation and material resistance change. When thermal radiation from target objects strikes the microbolometer surface, the absorbed energy increases the detector element temperature, causing a measurable change in electrical resistance. This resistance variation is then converted to voltage signals through integrated readout circuits, ultimately digitized by a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter to provide high-resolution temperature measurements with excellent dynamic range.

### 2.2 Optical System Design

The optical subsystem of both camera variants employs a carefully engineered germanium lens assembly designed to optimize thermal radiation transmission across the 8-14 μm long-wave infrared spectrum. Germanium represents the material of choice for thermal imaging optics due to its excellent transmission characteristics in the LWIR band, with transmission efficiency exceeding 45% across the relevant spectral range (Tropf et al., 1995) [^9]. The lens system implements a fixed focal length design with f/1.0 aperture ratio, providing a 25° × 19° field of view that balances measurement area coverage with spatial resolution requirements.

The selection of a 13mm focal length reflects optimization for the 12 μm pixel pitch of the detector array, ensuring that the optical system delivers appropriate sampling of the thermal scene without introducing significant optical aberrations. This focal length choice also minimizes the overall system size while maintaining compatibility with the compact form factor requirements of portable research equipment. The optical design incorporates anti-reflection coatings specifically optimized for the 8-14 μm spectral range, reducing optical losses and improving overall system sensitivity.

The integrated spectral filtering system ensures that only thermal radiation within the 8-14 μm long-wave infrared band reaches the detector array. This spectral selectivity is crucial for accurate temperature measurement, as it eliminates interference from shorter wavelength radiation that could introduce measurement errors, particularly in outdoor or variable lighting conditions. The atmospheric transmission characteristics within this spectral band are well-understood and documented (Schott, 2007) [^10], enabling reliable temperature measurements across a wide range of environmental conditions.

### 2.3 Communication Interface Architecture

The communication subsystem employs USB-C connectivity implementing the USB Video Class (UVC) protocol standard with vendor-specific extensions to enable both standardized video streaming capabilities and specialized radiometric data access. This dual-protocol approach ensures compatibility with standard USB infrastructure while providing the specialized functionality required for research-grade thermal data acquisition (USB Implementers Forum, 2021) [^2].

The USB 2.0 High Speed implementation provides theoretical bandwidth of 480 Mbps, though practical throughput for thermal data transmission typically achieves approximately 50 MB/s under optimal conditions. This bandwidth allocation proves sufficient for the 25 fps frame rate at 256×192 resolution with 16-bit depth, requiring approximately 25 MB/s for raw data transmission. The additional bandwidth capacity accommodates protocol overhead, command transmission, and status monitoring without compromising real-time performance requirements.

Power delivery through the USB-C interface follows the USB Power Delivery specification, enabling bus-powered operation up to 2.5W maximum consumption. This power budget covers all camera subsystems including the microbolometer array, readout electronics, internal processing, and USB communication interface. The bus-powered design eliminates the need for external power supplies, significantly simplifying deployment logistics for field research applications while ensuring consistent power delivery characteristics across different host devices.

The endpoint configuration implements a sophisticated communication architecture utilizing four distinct USB endpoints, each optimized for specific data types and communication patterns. Control transfers handle device enumeration and configuration commands, bulk transfers manage high-throughput thermal frame data, and interrupt transfers provide real-time status notifications and error reporting. This multi-endpoint approach enables concurrent operations without mutual interference, ensuring that configuration changes or status monitoring do not disrupt the continuous thermal data stream required for real-time applications.

### 2.4 Hardware Detection and Configuration

The hardware detection and configuration subsystem implements sophisticated device identification algorithms that enable automatic recognition and optimization for different camera variants within the TopDon thermal imaging family. This automated approach significantly simplifies deployment procedures while ensuring optimal performance configuration for each specific hardware variant.

The device identification process begins with USB vendor and product ID verification, utilizing the standardized USB device descriptor framework to establish initial device compatibility. The TopDon vendor ID (0x3496) serves as the primary identification marker, while secondary product ID values differentiate between camera variants and their specific capabilities. This hierarchical identification approach follows established USB device enumeration protocols while enabling fine-grained hardware variant detection (USB Implementers Forum, 2021) [^2].

Beyond basic device identification, the system implements dynamic capability assessment through structured queries to the camera's embedded firmware. This interrogation process determines specific hardware characteristics including temperature measurement ranges, frame rate capabilities, and thermal sensitivity specifications. The automated capability detection ensures that software configuration parameters align precisely with hardware limitations, preventing configuration errors that could compromise measurement accuracy or system stability.

The variant-specific configuration system automatically adjusts operational parameters based on detected hardware capabilities. For instance, the TC001 Plus variant automatically configures extended temperature measurement ranges and enhanced accuracy parameters, while the standard TC001 model optimizes for its specific operational characteristics. This automated configuration approach reduces user error potential while ensuring optimal performance across the entire device family range.

## 3. SDK Integration and Architecture

The software development kit integration represents a sophisticated abstraction layer that bridges the complex hardware-specific protocols of thermal imaging systems with the standardized application programming interfaces expected by research software applications. The TopDon SDK 1.3.7 architecture embodies principles of layered software design, implementing clear separation between hardware communication, data processing, and application interface layers (Gamma et al., 1994) [^11].

### 3.1 TopDon SDK 1.3.7 Architecture

The SDK architecture implements a comprehensive abstraction framework that encapsulates the complexity of thermal camera hardware communication while providing intuitive programming interfaces for application developers. This design philosophy enables researchers to focus on thermal data analysis and interpretation rather than low-level hardware management details, significantly reducing the technical barriers to implementing thermal sensing in research applications.

The core architecture centers around several key abstraction components, each addressing specific aspects of thermal camera operation. The LibIRProcess module handles all aspects of raw thermal data processing, implementing sophisticated algorithms for non-uniformity correction, temperature calibration, and pseudo-color generation. These processing algorithms are based on established thermal imaging principles documented in the thermal imaging literature (Holst, 2000) [^3], ensuring accurate and reliable thermal measurements across varying operational conditions.

The USBMonitor component provides robust device management capabilities, implementing automated device detection, connection monitoring, and error recovery procedures. This subsystem operates continuously in the background, providing the reliability and fault tolerance essential for research applications where data loss due to hardware communication failures would compromise experimental validity. The monitoring system implements exponential backoff algorithms for connection retries and maintains detailed logging of all device communication events for post-analysis troubleshooting.

The UVCCamera abstraction layer bridges the gap between standard USB Video Class protocols and the specialized requirements of thermal imaging applications. While UVC provides standardized video streaming capabilities, thermal cameras require additional functionality for accessing raw radiometric data, controlling internal calibration procedures, and managing device-specific configuration parameters. The SDK implementation seamlessly integrates these specialized functions with standard UVC operations, providing a unified interface that supports both conventional video streaming and advanced thermal imaging requirements.

### 3.3 Data Flow Architecture

The data flow architecture implements a sophisticated pipeline that manages the transformation of raw thermal sensor data through multiple processing stages to produce both real-time display images and research-quality radiometric data. This architecture draws from established principles of stream processing systems (Stonebraker et al., 2005) [^12], adapting these concepts for the specific requirements of real-time thermal imaging applications.

The data flow begins with raw frame capture from the USB device, where timing precision becomes critically important for research applications requiring accurate temporal correlation with other sensor modalities. The system implements hardware timestamp capture at the point of frame reception, ensuring microsecond-level timing accuracy essential for multi-modal synchronization. This timing information travels with each frame throughout the processing pipeline, enabling precise temporal alignment during post-analysis procedures.

The parallel processing architecture enables simultaneous real-time display generation and research data storage without mutual interference. The real-time display branch implements optimized pseudo-color conversion and image scaling specifically tuned for mobile display requirements, while the research data branch preserves full radiometric accuracy through lossless processing algorithms. This dual-path approach ensures that visualization performance requirements do not compromise the integrity of stored research data.

The processing pipeline incorporates intelligent buffering and flow control mechanisms that adapt to varying system loads and processing capabilities. During periods of high computational demand, the system implements priority-based processing that ensures research data integrity takes precedence over display update rates. This adaptive approach maintains data collection reliability even under challenging operational conditions where system resources become constrained.

## 4. API Reference and Implementation

The Application Programming Interface design embodies principles of modern software architecture, providing intuitive abstractions for complex thermal imaging operations while maintaining the flexibility and precision required for research applications. The API architecture follows established patterns from contemporary mobile development frameworks, implementing reactive programming principles and type-safe interfaces that reduce common programming errors while enabling sophisticated thermal data manipulation (Patterson & Hennessy, 2019) [^13].

### 4.1 ThermalRecorder API

The ThermalRecorder API serves as the primary interface for thermal camera control and data acquisition, implementing a comprehensive set of methods that abstract the complexity of hardware communication while providing fine-grained control over thermal measurement parameters. The API design prioritizes both ease of use for basic operations and extensibility for advanced research applications requiring specialized configuration.

The initialization and recording control methods provide straightforward session management while incorporating robust error handling and state validation. The `initializeCamera()` method performs comprehensive hardware validation and capability negotiation, ensuring that requested configuration parameters align with detected hardware capabilities. This validation approach prevents runtime errors that could compromise data collection integrity, particularly important in research contexts where experimental reproduction requires consistent hardware behavior.

Temperature measurement configuration methods enable precise control over measurement parameters essential for accurate thermal data collection. The `setEmissivity()` and `setTemperatureRange()` methods incorporate validation algorithms that ensure parameter values remain within physically meaningful ranges while providing appropriate warnings when configuration choices might impact measurement accuracy.

The Samsung Galaxy S22 represents the recommended platform due to its proven compatibility, robust USB implementation, and sufficient processing capability for real-time thermal data processing.

Cable selection proves more critical than might initially appear, as USB-C cables vary significantly in their data transmission capabilities and power delivery characteristics. Research applications require cables that support both high-speed data transmission and adequate power delivery, specifications that are not guaranteed in all USB-C cables despite apparent physical compatibility. Quality verification through testing with known thermal data transmission loads ensures reliable operation during critical data collection periods.

Storage requirements scale significantly beyond casual usage patterns, reflecting the data-intensive nature of thermal imaging research. A typical 10-minute recording session generates approximately 750 MB of raw thermal data, requiring careful storage planning for extended research protocols. The storage calculations must also account for multiple data formats generated during each session, including raw thermal data, processed visualization files, and comprehensive metadata records essential for research documentation and analysis.

### 7.2 Pre-flight Checklist

The pre-flight checklist represents critical validation procedures that prevent common deployment failures and ensure optimal thermal measurement performance throughout research sessions.

Battery charge verification extends beyond simple percentage checking to include assessment of battery health and expected operational duration under thermal imaging loads, which typically exceed normal smartphone usage patterns due to continuous USB device operation and intensive data processing requirements.

Cable and connectivity validation requires functional testing rather than simple visual inspection, as USB-C cables can fail to support data transmission requirements while maintaining power delivery capabilities. The verification process should include actual thermal data transmission testing to confirm that the selected cable supports the full bandwidth requirements of real-time thermal imaging applications.

Storage preparation encompasses both capacity verification and performance assessment, ensuring that storage systems can accommodate the sustained write rates required for continuous thermal data recording. Modern research protocols often require extended recording sessions that can generate several gigabytes of thermal data, necessitating both adequate capacity and sufficient write performance to prevent data loss during peak recording periods.

Environmental assessment addresses factors that significantly impact thermal measurement accuracy but are often overlooked in deployment planning. Ambient temperature stability, air current patterns, and thermal reflection sources all influence measurement accuracy and should be evaluated before beginning critical data collection sessions. The thermal imaging literature provides comprehensive guidance on environmental factors that affect measurement accuracy (Ring & Ammer, 2012) [^4], emphasizing the importance of controlled conditions for research applications.

## 9. Troubleshooting and Diagnostics

The diagnostic and troubleshooting framework provides comprehensive problem identification and resolution procedures that address common deployment challenges while maintaining system reliability under demanding research conditions. The diagnostic approach implements systematic problem classification and resolution procedures that enable both automated recovery and guided manual intervention based on problem severity and complexity.

### 9.1 Common Connection Issues

Connection reliability represents one of the most critical aspects of thermal imaging system deployment, as communication failures can result in data loss and experimental invalidation. The troubleshooting approach addresses connection problems through systematic diagnosis that identifies root causes rather than addressing symptoms, enabling more effective resolution and prevention of recurring issues.

Device detection failures often result from complex interactions between Android's USB management framework, device driver compatibility, and power management policies that may not be immediately apparent to users. The diagnostic procedures guide users through systematic verification of USB OTG capabilities, driver installation status, and device permission configurations while providing fallback procedures for challenging deployment scenarios.

Permission management complications arise from Android's sophisticated security framework that requires explicit user consent for USB device access while implementing complex permission inheritance and revocation policies. The troubleshooting guidance addresses both initial permission configuration and dynamic permission management scenarios that can occur during extended research sessions when system updates or security policy changes might affect device access.

Cable and connectivity problems represent surprisingly common failure modes in research deployments, as USB-C cable specifications vary significantly despite apparent physical compatibility. The diagnostic procedures include functional testing approaches that verify both power delivery and data transmission capabilities under thermal imaging load conditions, enabling identification of marginal cables that might function adequately for basic USB operations but fail under the sustained data rates required for thermal imaging applications.

## 12. Integration with Multi-Sensor Recording System

The thermal camera integration within the Multi-Sensor Recording System represents a sophisticated example of heterogeneous sensor coordination, demonstrating how thermal imaging capabilities can be seamlessly incorporated into comprehensive physiological and behavioral research platforms. This integration addresses fundamental challenges in multi-modal data collection, including temporal synchronization, data format standardization, and coordinated session management across diverse sensor technologies.

### 12.1 System Architecture Integration

The architectural approach implements a distributed sensing framework where thermal cameras function as specialized data collection nodes within a coordinated research ecosystem. This design leverages the strengths of different computing platforms—utilizing the Android mobile environment for thermal data collection while coordinating overall system operation through a PC-based master controller that manages session coordination, data aggregation, and multi-modal synchronization.

The integration strategy recognizes that different sensor modalities have distinct operational characteristics, data rates, and processing requirements that necessitate specialized handling while maintaining coordinated operation. The thermal imaging subsystem operates semi-autonomously within its Android environment while participating in coordinated data collection protocols managed by the PC coordinator. This approach enables optimal performance for each sensor modality while ensuring synchronized operation essential for multi-modal research applications.

The data flow architecture implements sophisticated buffering and synchronization mechanisms that accommodate the different data rates and processing requirements of diverse sensor modalities. Thermal imaging generates approximately 50 MB/s of data during active recording, significantly exceeding the data rates of physiological sensors but requiring coordination with video recording systems that may generate comparable data volumes. The synchronization framework addresses these rate mismatches while maintaining temporal alignment accuracy essential for multi-modal analysis.

### 12.2 Synchronization with Other Sensors

The multi-modal synchronization architecture addresses one of the most challenging aspects of coordinated sensor operation: maintaining precise temporal alignment across heterogeneous data collection systems operating under different timing constraints and processing delays. The synchronization approach implements multiple complementary techniques that ensure temporal accuracy while accommodating the practical constraints of diverse sensor technologies and computing platforms.

The synchronization foundation relies on establishing a master time reference that provides consistent temporal coordination across all sensor modalities. The PC-based coordinator maintains this master clock while distributing synchronization signals and coordinating data collection timing across different sensor systems. This centralized approach ensures consistent temporal reference while enabling distributed processing that optimizes performance for each sensor modality.

Clock offset compensation addresses the inevitable timing differences that arise between independent computing systems, each maintaining their own system clocks with different accuracy characteristics and drift patterns. The compensation algorithms continuously monitor timing relationships between sensor systems, implementing statistical analysis of timing patterns to distinguish between systematic offsets and random variations that require different correction approaches.

The drift compensation mechanisms implement predictive algorithms that anticipate timing variations based on observed system behavior patterns, enabling proactive correction before timing errors accumulate to levels that would compromise data analysis validity. These algorithms incorporate temperature compensation, load-dependent variations, and other factors that influence system timing accuracy over extended operational periods typical of research data collection sessions.

### 12.3 Research Data Integration

The unified data integration framework enables sophisticated multi-modal analysis by providing standardized data formats and temporal alignment that support comprehensive research workflows spanning thermal physiology, stress response analysis, and human-computer interaction studies. The integration approach recognizes that thermal imaging provides unique insights into physiological processes that complement traditional physiological measurements while requiring careful coordination to realize the full analytical potential of multi-modal data collection.

The data format standardization implements comprehensive metadata schemas that preserve essential information from each sensor modality while enabling cross-modal analysis and correlation studies. The thermal imaging metadata includes not only measurement parameters and calibration information but also environmental conditions and system status information that enables researchers to assess data quality and identify factors that might influence analytical results.

Session coordination procedures ensure that multi-modal data collection maintains experimental integrity while accommodating the different operational characteristics of diverse sensor technologies. The coordination framework manages session initialization, data collection timing, and session termination procedures that ensure all sensor modalities capture data during identical time periods while maintaining appropriate sampling rates and data quality standards for each modality.

The quality assurance framework implements continuous monitoring of data collection quality across all sensor modalities, providing real-time feedback that enables researchers to identify and address data quality issues before they compromise experimental validity. The monitoring includes assessment of synchronization accuracy, signal quality, and system performance metrics that ensure research data meets quality standards essential for rigorous scientific analysis.

The thermal imaging capabilities within the Multi-Sensor Recording System enable diverse research applications that leverage the unique insights provided by thermal measurements in combination with complementary physiological and behavioral data collection modalities. These applications demonstrate the significant research potential that emerges when thermal imaging is integrated with comprehensive multi-modal data collection frameworks rather than employed as an isolated measurement technique.

Thermal physiology research benefits significantly from the combination of thermal imaging with traditional physiological measurements, enabling detailed analysis of thermoregulatory responses that correlate thermal patterns with cardiovascular, respiratory, and autonomic nervous system activity. The synchronized data collection enables researchers to investigate the complex relationships between core body temperature regulation, peripheral thermal patterns, and physiological stress responses that would be difficult to characterize using any single measurement modality.

Stress response research represents a particularly promising application area where thermal imaging provides non-invasive insights into autonomic nervous system activity that complement traditional stress indicators such as galvanic skin response, heart rate variability, and cortisol measurements. The multi-modal approach enables comprehensive characterization of stress responses while providing validation of thermal indicators through correlation with established physiological stress markers.

Human-computer interaction studies benefit from the combination of thermal measurement with behavioral observation and physiological monitoring, enabling investigation of user experience and cognitive load through multiple complementary measurement channels. The thermal imaging provides insights into autonomic responses to interface design and interaction complexity while physiological measurements provide additional context for interpreting thermal patterns in terms of cognitive and emotional responses to technological interfaces.

## Appendices

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Quick Reference

The quick reference guide provides essential operational information for rapid deployment and troubleshooting, consolidating the most frequently needed procedures and specifications into an accessible format suitable for field reference during research deployments.

The connection sequence represents the standardized procedure for establishing thermal camera connectivity that has been validated across multiple research deployments and device configurations. These procedures incorporate lessons learned from field experience and address common pitfalls that can delay deployment or compromise data collection reliability. The sequence emphasizes verification steps that ensure reliable operation before beginning critical data collection procedures.

Essential configuration parameters reflect optimal settings derived from research application experience and thermal imaging best practices. The recommended frame rate of 25 fps provides adequate temporal resolution for most physiological research applications while ensuring reliable data transmission and processing performance. The default emissivity setting of 0.95 accommodates most biological and fabric materials commonly encountered in human subjects research, though material-specific adjustments remain important for precision applications.

Emergency procedures address critical scenarios where immediate action is required to preserve data integrity or system safety. The data recovery procedures recognize that partial data files may contain valuable research information even when normal recording termination procedures were not completed. The emergency stop procedures ensure that both graceful shutdown and immediate termination options are available depending on the urgency of the situation requiring intervention.

### Appendix B: Material Emissivity Reference

Material emissivity values represent critical parameters for accurate thermal measurement, as emissivity directly affects the relationship between surface temperature and radiated thermal energy detected by thermal imaging systems. The emissivity reference table provides validated values derived from thermal imaging literature and standardized measurement procedures (International Organization for Standardization, 2018) [^16].

The emissivity values for biological materials demonstrate remarkably consistent characteristics across different skin types and conditions, with human skin maintaining emissivity values near 0.98 regardless of pigmentation or surface condition. This consistency makes thermal imaging particularly valuable for medical and physiological research applications where skin temperature measurements provide insights into underlying physiological processes.

Material emissivity variations reflect fundamental differences in surface properties including molecular composition, surface texture, and optical characteristics that affect thermal radiation emission patterns. Metallic materials demonstrate the most dramatic emissivity variations, with polished surfaces exhibiting very low emissivity values due to specular reflection characteristics while oxidized or painted metal surfaces approach the high emissivity values typical of non-metallic materials.

The practical implications of emissivity variations become significant in research applications where measurement accuracy requirements exceed the uncertainties introduced by incorrect emissivity assumptions. Research protocols should include emissivity verification procedures when measurement accuracy requirements approach the level where emissivity uncertainties could affect analytical conclusions or experimental validity.

| Material | Emissivity (ε) | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Human skin | 0.98 | Independent of skin color |
| Water | 0.96 | Clean water surface |
| Concrete | 0.95 | Aged concrete |
| Paint (non-metallic) | 0.90-0.95 | Most standard paints |
| Plastic | 0.90-0.95 | Most thermoplastics |
| Fabric | 0.85-0.95 | Natural and synthetic |
| Oxidized metals | 0.80-0.95 | Rusted or painted |
| Anodized aluminum | 0.70-0.80 | Depends on finish |
| Polished aluminum | 0.05-0.10 | Highly reflective |
| Polished steel | 0.10-0.30 | Mirror-like finish |

### Appendix C: Error Code Reference

The error code classification system provides systematic categorization of system faults and operational issues that enables both automated error handling and guided manual troubleshooting procedures. The error classification approach implements severity-based categorization that prioritizes response procedures based on potential impact on data collection integrity and system safety.

Critical errors represent conditions that require immediate attention and typically result in data collection termination to prevent data corruption or system damage. These errors usually indicate hardware failures, communication breakdowns, or safety conditions that exceed normal operational parameters. The recovery procedures for critical errors emphasize data preservation and system safety while providing guidance for restoring operational capability when possible.

Medium and low severity errors represent operational issues that can often be resolved through automated recovery procedures or minor operational adjustments without terminating data collection sessions. The error handling system implements intelligent retry algorithms and graceful degradation procedures that maintain data collection capability while addressing underlying issues that might eventually escalate to more serious conditions if left unresolved.

The error logging and reporting framework maintains comprehensive records of all error conditions and recovery actions, providing valuable diagnostic information for both immediate troubleshooting and long-term system optimization. The error records include timing information, system state data, and environmental conditions that enable systematic analysis of error patterns and development of preventive maintenance procedures that improve system reliability over time.

| Error Code | Name | Severity | Description | Recovery Action |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **1001** | USB_DEVICE_DISCONNECTED | Critical | USB connection lost | Reconnect device and restart |
| **1002** | CAMERA_INITIALIZATION_FAILED | Critical | Camera hardware failure | Check compatibility and permissions |
| **2001** | FRAME_TRANSMISSION_TIMEOUT | High | Data transmission timeout | Check USB cable and bandwidth |
| **3001** | CALIBRATION_ACCURACY_DEGRADED | Medium | Temperature accuracy reduced | Perform recalibration |
| **4001** | FRAME_CORRUPTION_DETECTED | Medium | Corrupted frame data | Restart streaming and verify connection |
| **5001** | INVALID_TEMPERATURE_RANGE | Low | Invalid range parameters | Adjust temperature range settings |
