## Introduction to Contactless Physiological Monitoring

Computer vision has emerged as one of the most promising and transformative technological approaches for extracting detailed physiological information from visual data streams, enabling sophisticated contactless monitoring of vital signs, health parameters, and autonomic nervous system activity that was previously only possible through direct physical contact with specialized medical sensors.

### Evolution of Remote Sensing Technologies

The journey toward contactless physiological monitoring has evolved through several technological generations:

- **First Generation (1980s-1990s):** Basic motion detection using infrared sensors for breathing patterns
- **Second Generation (2000s-2010s):** Camera-based vital sign detection, primarily heart rate estimation using webcams
- **Third Generation (2010s-Present):** Multi-modal integration (RGB, thermal, depth) with machine learning
- **Current Generation (2020s-Present):** AI-driven systems with simultaneous multi-parameter estimation

## Galvanic Skin Response: Physiological Background

### Neurophysiological Basis of GSR

Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), also recognized as Electrodermal Activity (EDA) or Skin Conductance Response (SCR), represents one of the most direct and sensitive physiological measurements of sympathetic nervous system activation. The underlying mechanism involves electrical conductance characteristics of human skin, which undergo systematic variations in response to sympathetic nervous system activation patterns.

```

#### Key Physiological Characteristics

**Unique Innervation Pattern:** Unlike most autonomic functions that receive dual innervation, eccrine sweat glands are exclusively under sympathetic cholinergic control, making GSR an unambiguous indicator of sympathetic nervous system activation.

**Signal Morphology:** The temporal dynamics create characteristic GSR signal patterns:
- **Rising Phase:** 1-2 seconds (rapid electrolyte secretion)
- **Peak Response:** Maximum conductance change
- **Recovery Phase:** 5-15 seconds (gradual reabsorption)

**Anatomical Distribution:** Highest sweat gland density occurs on palms (200-700 glands/cm²), making them optimal for GSR measurement.

### GSR Signal Characteristics

| Characteristic | Value | Clinical Significance |
|---------------|-------|----------------------|
| **Response Latency** | 1-3 seconds | Indicates neural processing delay |
| **Rise Time** | 1-2 seconds | Reflects sympathetic activation intensity |
| **Recovery Time** | 5-15 seconds | Shows autonomic regulation efficiency |
| **Amplitude Range** | 0.01-50 μS | Varies with arousal level and individual differences |
| **Frequency Content** | 0.01-1 Hz | Primary physiological response band |

```

**Results:** Achieves 95% confidence level in quality assessments with p-values consistently below 0.05.
