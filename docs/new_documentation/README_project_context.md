## Research Problem Definition

### Problem Context and Scientific Motivation

The measurement and analysis of Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), also recognized as Electrodermal Activity (EDA) or Skin Conductance Response (SCR), has represented one of the most fundamental physiological monitoring techniques in psychological research, clinical assessment, affective computing, and human-computer interaction applications for more than a century.

### Limitations of Current GSR Measurement Approaches

#### Physical Constraints and Behavioral Interference

Contact electrodes fundamentally restrict natural movement patterns and spontaneous behavior, potentially introducing systematic alterations to the very physiological responses that researchers are attempting to measure. This constraint proves particularly problematic in:

- **Naturalistic Studies:** Research requiring unencumbered behavior patterns
- **Long-term Monitoring:** Ecological monitoring where sustained electrode attachment is impractical
- **Clinical Assessments:** Situations where monitoring equipment might influence patient behavior

#### Hygiene, Safety, and Cross-Contamination Concerns

Direct skin contact through electrodes raises significant concerns about:

- **Cross-contamination:** Between research subjects and potential disease transmission
- **Clinical Safety:** Particularly relevant in pediatric research and pandemic conditions
- **Operational Complexity:** Electrode sterilization, conductive gel disposal, cleaning protocols

#### Subject Comfort and Participation Barriers

Many research subjects find electrodes uncomfortable or anxiety-provoking, which can:

- **Introduce Artifacts:** Stress responses caused by measurement equipment itself
- **Limit Participation:** Particularly among pediatric, elderly, or anxious populations
- **Bias Results:** Systematic alterations due to measurement awareness

### Research Gap Analysis and Innovation Opportunities

#### Identified Research Gaps

1. **Contactless Measurement Accuracy:** Current methods achieve only 60-70% correlation with contact measurements
2. **Environmental Robustness:** Performance degradation under varying conditions
3. **Population Diversity:** Limited validation across demographic groups
4. **Real-Time Processing:** Focus on offline analysis rather than real-time applications
5. **Standardized Protocols:** Lack of consistent validation methodologies

#### Innovation Framework

**Primary Innovation:** Development of a contactless GSR prediction system using multi-modal sensor fusion combining:
- RGB camera data for subtle physiological changes
- Thermal imaging for autonomic nervous system indicators
- Direct GSR measurements for validation and training

**Secondary Innovations:**
- Real-time processing capabilities for mobile devices
- Statistical validation framework with confidence intervals
- Adaptive quality assessment using machine learning
- Cross-platform compatibility and scalability

## Project Objectives and Scope

### Primary Research Hypothesis

**H₁:** Multi-modal sensor fusion combining RGB camera data, thermal imaging, and direct GSR measurements can achieve contactless GSR prediction accuracy exceeding 80% correlation with traditional contact-based measurements under controlled conditions.

### Secondary Hypotheses and Research Questions

**H₂:** Real-time processing algorithms can be optimized for mobile device deployment while maintaining measurement accuracy within 10% of offline processing results.

**H₃:** Statistical validation frameworks can provide quantified confidence intervals for GSR predictions, enabling reliable assessment of measurement uncertainty.

**Research Questions:**
1. What is the optimal feature extraction methodology for multi-modal physiological data?
2. How do environmental conditions affect contactless GSR prediction accuracy?
3. What are the demographic factors that influence system performance?
4. How can machine learning models be adapted for individual users?

### Technical Problem Formulation

#### Mathematical Problem Definition

Given a multi-sensor system M = {GSR, Thermal, RGB} with individual sampling rates R = {r₁, r₂, r₃} and inherent latencies L = {l₁, l₂, l₃}, establish:

1. **Temporal Synchronization:** Unified timestamp reference T_ref such that:
   ```
   ∀t ∈ acquisition_period, |T_sensor(t) - T_ref(t)| < ε_temporal
   ```
   Where ε_temporal < 10ms for physiological applications

2. **Spatial Calibration:** Geometric transformation matrix H mapping spatial coordinates:
   ```
   H_i = argmin_H Σ(j=1 to n_i) ||H · p_j^sensor - p_j^reference||²
   ```

3. **Quality Assessment:** Quality function Q: CalibrationData → [0,1] quantifying reliability
