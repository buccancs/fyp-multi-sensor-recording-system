## Overview

The Multi-Device Synchronization System ensures that all your recording devices (smartphones, thermal cameras, webcams, and physiological sensors) capture data at exactly the same moments in time. This guide will help you set up, use, and troubleshoot the synchronization system for your research experiments.

## What is Multi-Device Synchronization?

When conducting research with multiple sensors, it's crucial that all devices record data simultaneously. Even tiny timing differences (milliseconds) can make it impossible to correlate data between different sensors. Our synchronization system acts like a master conductor, ensuring all devices start and stop recording at precisely the same time.

### Why Synchronization Matters

- **Accurate Data Correlation:** Compare thermal, video, and physiological data from the exact same moments
- **Valid Research Results:** Ensure timing precision required for scientific analysis
- **Event Timing:** Precisely measure responses to stimuli across all sensor modalities
- **Quality Assurance:** Maintain research-grade data collection standards

## Pre-flight Checklist

Before starting your recording session, ensure these prerequisites are met:

### Network Requirements
