## System Architecture Overview

### Integrated Architecture Philosophy

The Shimmer Manager and PC Application integration embodies a comprehensive architectural philosophy that balances centralized research control with distributed device autonomy, following established principles of distributed system design (Coulouris et al., 2011). This philosophy recognizes that physiological measurement research requires both the precision and coordination capabilities of desktop systems and the mobility and sensor integration advantages of mobile platforms, addressing challenges identified in mobile health computing research (Kumar et al., 2013; Klasnja & Pratt, 2012).

#### Core Architectural Principles

The system operates on four fundamental architectural principles that guide design decisions and implementation choices. The unified command and control principle establishes the PC Application as the central research orchestrator while maintaining flexibility for distributed operation, implementing patterns from centralized coordination architectures (Lynch, 1996). Distributed sensor intelligence enables the Shimmer Manager to provide intelligent device management with local decision-making capabilities, following autonomous agent design principles (Wooldridge, 2009).

Seamless data integration ensures transparent data flow between mobile collection and desktop analysis with preserved metadata and quality metrics, addressing data provenance requirements in scientific computing (Freire et al., 2008). Fault-tolerant coordination mechanisms maintain research session integrity despite component failures, implementing reliability patterns established in critical system design (Laprie et al., 1995).

### Component Interaction Model

The integration architecture implements a sophisticated component interaction model that provides clear separation of concerns while enabling seamless coordination between PC and mobile platforms, following established patterns from distributed system architectures (Birman, 2005). This model balances the need for centralized control with distributed processing capabilities, addressing challenges identified in mobile-cloud computing integration (Fernando et al., 2013).

#### Primary Interaction Patterns

The system implements four primary interaction patterns that govern communication and coordination between components. The command-response pattern enables the PC Application to issue research commands that are executed by Shimmer Manager with confirmation and status reporting, following request-reply protocols established in distributed systems (Tanenbaum & Van Steen, 2017). Event-driven updates provide real-time status and data updates flowing from Shimmer Manager to PC Application through event callbacks, implementing observer pattern principles (Gamma et al., 1994).

Session synchronization ensures coordinated session lifecycle management with temporal alignment across all components, building upon distributed transaction processing concepts (Gray & Reuter, 1992). The quality feedback loop maintains continuous quality assessment and optimization based on real-time data analysis, implementing control theory principles for adaptive system behavior (Franklin et al., 2014).

### System Topology

The integrated system implements a hybrid star-mesh topology that combines the control simplicity of centralized coordination with the resilience advantages of distributed processing, building upon established network topology research (Bertsekas & Gallager, 1992). This topology design addresses the dual requirements of research control centralization and operational fault tolerance.

The star component establishes the PC Application as the central hub for research coordination, session management, and data aggregation, following centralized architecture patterns that facilitate control and monitoring (Mullender, 1993). The mesh component enables Shimmer Manager nodes to coordinate directly for time-critical operations while maintaining connection to the central hub, implementing distributed coordination principles that enhance system resilience (Tel, 2000).

This hybrid approach provides significant advantages including centralized research control and session management, distributed fault tolerance and real-time processing capabilities, scalable architecture supporting additional devices and platforms, and flexible deployment supporting both laboratory and field research scenarios. The topology design follows established principles for balancing centralization and distribution in complex systems (van Steen & Tanenbaum, 2016).

## Shimmer Manager Implementation

### Core Architecture

The Shimmer Manager serves as the sophisticated device orchestration layer that provides unified access to Shimmer3 GSR+ devices through multiple connection paradigms, implementing advanced sensor integration patterns established in wireless sensor network research (Zhao & Guibas, 2004). The architecture embodies principles of service-oriented architecture while maintaining research-grade reliability and precision requirements for physiological measurement applications (Boulis et al., 2003).

#### Architectural Design Principles

The implementation follows four fundamental design principles that ensure system reliability and extensibility. The unified device interface provides a single API abstraction for both direct Bluetooth and Android-mediated connections, implementing the facade pattern to simplify complex subsystem interactions (Gamma et al., 1994). State machine management enables comprehensive device lifecycle management with clear state transitions, following formal state machine design principles for embedded systems (Lee & Seshia, 2016).

Real-time processing capabilities are achieved through a low-latency data processing pipeline optimized for physiological measurement requirements, implementing real-time system design patterns (Liu, 2000). Fault-tolerant operation is ensured through robust error handling and automatic recovery mechanisms, following established patterns for reliable distributed system design (Schneider, 1990).

        self.data_callbacks: List[Callable[[ShimmerSample], None]] = []
        self.status_callbacks: List[Callable[[str, ShimmerStatus], None]] = []
```

        'simulated': []
    }
    
    # Parallel discovery operations
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
        # Direct Bluetooth scanning
        bluetooth_future = executor.submit(self._scan_direct_bluetooth_devices)
        
        # Android device discovery
        android_future = executor.submit(self._discover_android_devices)
        
        # Wait for all discovery methods
        discovered_devices['direct'] = bluetooth_future.result()
        discovered_devices['android'] = android_future.result()
        
        # Add simulation devices if enabled
        if self.enable_simulation:
            discovered_devices['simulated'] = self._generate_simulation_devices()
    
    return discovered_devices
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

The data processing pipeline implements high-throughput, low-latency processing optimized for real-time physiological measurement with comprehensive quality assurance, building upon established real-time data processing architectures (Stankovic et al., 1998) and quality-aware sensor data management principles (Elnahrawy & Nath, 2004). The pipeline design addresses the dual requirements of maintaining temporal precision and ensuring data integrity for research-grade physiological measurements.

    end
    
    loop Continuous Processing
        DEV->>SM: Next Sample
    end
```

#### Real-Time Processing Implementation

The real-time processing implementation achieves high-performance data handling with minimal latency through sophisticated threading and queue management strategies, following established patterns for real-time embedded systems (Kopetz, 1997) and concurrent data processing architectures (Lea, 1999):

```python
def _data_processing_loop(self) -> None:
    """High-performance data processing with minimal latency"""
    while not self.stop_event.is_set():
        try:
            # Process data from all device queues concurrently
            for device_id, data_queue in self.data_queues.items():
                try:
                    # Non-blocking queue processing
                    sample = data_queue.get_nowait()
                    
                    # Parallel validation and processing
                    if self._validate_sample_data(sample):
                        # Immediate callback notification
                        for callback in self.data_callbacks:
                            self.thread_pool.submit(callback, sample)
                        
                        # Asynchronous file writing
                        if self.is_recording:
                            self.thread_pool.submit(self._write_sample_to_file, device_id, sample)
                            
                except queue.Empty:
                    continue
                    
            time.sleep(0.01)  # Prevent CPU saturation
            
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Data processing error: {e}")
            time.sleep(1.0)
```

### Android Integration Layer

The Android integration layer provides seamless coordination between PC-based research control and mobile device sensor capabilities through sophisticated mapping and communication protocols, implementing cross-platform integration patterns established in mobile computing research (Satyanarayanan, 1996; Noble et al., 1997). This layer addresses the complexity of coordinating heterogeneous platforms while maintaining data consistency and temporal synchronization across the distributed system.

#### Integration Architecture

The integration architecture implements sophisticated device mapping and protocol translation mechanisms that enable transparent communication between Android-based sensor platforms and PC-based research coordination systems, following established patterns for heterogeneous system integration (Schmidt, 2006):

```python
def _on_android_shimmer_data(self, sample: ShimmerDataSample) -> None:
    """Process Shimmer data received from Android devices"""
    try:
        # Map Android device to Shimmer device
        if sample.android_device_id not in self.android_shimmer_mapping:
            self.logger.warning(f"Unmapped Android device: {sample.android_device_id}")
            return
        
        shimmer_device_id = self.android_shimmer_mapping[sample.android_device_id]
        
        # Convert to standardized format
        shimmer_sample = ShimmerSample(
            timestamp=sample.timestamp,
            system_time=datetime.fromtimestamp(sample.timestamp).isoformat(),
            device_id=shimmer_device_id,
            connection_type=ConnectionType.ANDROID_MEDIATED,
            android_device_id=sample.android_device_id,
            session_id=sample.session_id
        )
        
        # Map sensor values with validation
        for sensor_name, value in sample.sensor_values.items():
            if sensor_name == 'gsr_conductance':
                shimmer_sample.gsr_conductance = value
            elif sensor_name == 'ppg_a13':
                shimmer_sample.ppg_a13 = value
            # Additional sensor mappings...
        
        # Integrate into standard processing pipeline
        if self._validate_sample_data(shimmer_sample):
            self.data_queues[shimmer_device_id].put_nowait(shimmer_sample)
            
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Android data processing error: {e}")
```

## PC Application Implementation

### Application Container Architecture

The PC Application implements a sophisticated dependency injection container that manages the lifecycle of all backend services while providing clean separation of concerns and robust error handling, following established patterns for enterprise application architecture (Fowler, 2002) and inversion of control design principles (Johnson & Foote, 1988).

#### Container Design Philosophy

The container design philosophy embraces four core principles that ensure system maintainability and extensibility. Service composition enables clean dependency injection with explicit service relationships, implementing dependency injection patterns that facilitate testing and modularity (Fowler, 2004). Lifecycle management provides coordinated startup, operation, and shutdown of all system components, following established patterns for application lifecycle management in distributed systems (Hohpe & Woolf, 2003).

Configuration management centralizes configuration handling with environment-specific adaptations, implementing configuration management best practices for enterprise applications (Humble & Farley, 2010). Error boundary capabilities provide comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation, following fault tolerance patterns established in resilient system design (Utas, 2005).

```python
class Application(QObject):
    """
    Main dependency injection container and lifecycle manager.
    Coordinates all backend services and provides UI integration points.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, use_simplified_ui=True):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Core service initialization
        self.session_manager = SessionManager()
        self.shimmer_manager = ShimmerManager(
            session_manager=self.session_manager,
            enable_android_integration=True
        )
        
        # Network services
        self.json_server = JsonSocketServer(
            session_manager=self.session_manager,
            port=9000
        )
        
        # Hardware services
        self.webcam_capture = WebcamCapture()
        self.calibration_manager = CalibrationManager()
        
        # Integration services
        self.main_controller = MainController()
        
        # Service dependency configuration
        self._configure_service_dependencies()
        
        # UI initialization
        self.main_window = self._create_main_window(use_simplified_ui)
```

### Session Coordination System

The session coordination system orchestrates multi-device recording sessions with sophisticated lifecycle management, error recovery, and data integrity assurance, implementing session management patterns established in distributed transaction processing (Gray & Reuter, 1992) and workflow management systems (van der Aalst & van Hee, 2004).

#### Session Lifecycle Architecture

The session lifecycle architecture implements a comprehensive state machine that manages the complex transitions required for coordinated multi-device recording sessions, following formal verification principles for distributed system protocols (Lynch, 1996):

        self.compatibility_manager = CompatibilityManager()
        self.validation_framework = ExtensionValidationFramework()
        
    def register_sensor_extension(self, extension: SensorExtension) -> bool:
        """Register new sensor type with validation and integration testing"""
        
        # Validate extension compatibility
        compatibility_result = self.compatibility_manager.validate_extension(extension)
        if not compatibility_result.compatible:
            return False
        
        # Execute integration tests
        test_result = self.validation_framework.test_extension(extension)
        if not test_result.passed:
            return False
