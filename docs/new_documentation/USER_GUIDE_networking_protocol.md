## Step-by-Step Usage Guide

### Phase 1: PC Server Initialization

#### 1. Configure Network Settings

First, configure the network settings in the PC application:

1. **Open Configuration File**: Navigate to `/protocol/config.json`
2. **Set Network Parameters**:
   ```json
   {
     "network": {
       "host": "192.168.0.100",     // Your PC's IP address
       "port": 9000,                // Server listening port
       "timeout_seconds": 30,        // Connection timeout
       "max_connections": 10,        // Maximum concurrent devices
       "heartbeat_interval": 5       // Health check frequency
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Save Configuration**: Ensure the file is saved before starting the server

#### 2. Start PC Server

1. **Launch PC Application**: Open the Multi-Sensor Recording System PC application
2. **Initialize Server**: The server should automatically start on application launch
3. **Verify Server Status**: Look for "Server listening on port 9000" in the application logs
4. **Check Network Interface**: Ensure the correct network interface is selected

**Expected Output**: 
```
[INFO] PC Server initialized on 192.168.0.100:9000
[INFO] Waiting for device connections...
[INFO] Protocol version: 1.0.0
```

#### 3. Monitor Server Health
