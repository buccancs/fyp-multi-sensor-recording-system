# IDE Integration Test Suite

## Quick Start

This test suite implements the requirement to **"create a test that starts the PC app and the Android app through the IntelliJ IDE and tries all the buttons based on the navigation graph, knowing what follows what and checks if it was successful or not. also log everything"**.

### Running Multiple Full Test Suites

```bash
# Run all focused test suites using the orchestrator
./gradlew runAllFullTestSuites

# Or run individual focused test suites:
./gradlew runRecordingFullTest              # Recording functionality only
./gradlew runDeviceManagementFullTest       # Device management only  
./gradlew runCalibrationFullTest            # Calibration functionality only
./gradlew runFileManagementFullTest         # File operations only
./gradlew runNetworkConnectivityFullTest    # Network protocols only
```

### Running Legacy Comprehensive Test Suite

```bash
# Run the original comprehensive IDE integration test suite
./gradlew runIDEIntegrationTest

# Or run it directly
python test_ide_integration_suite.py
```

### Running Individual Components

```bash
# Python UI test only
./gradlew runPythonUITest

# Android UI test only (requires connected device)
./gradlew runIDEIntegrationUITest
```

### Navigation Testing Coverage

**Android App Navigation Structure:**
```
Navigation Drawer → Recording, Devices, Calibration, Files
Bottom Navigation → Record, Monitor, Calibrate
Settings Menu → Settings, Network Config, Shimmer Config
```

**Python App UI Structure:**
```
Tab Interface → Recording, Devices, Calibration, Files
Menu Bar → File, Edit, View, Tools, Help
Toolbar → Quick actions and status indicators
```

## Success Criteria

Each test validates:
- ✅ **Navigation Success**: Target screen loads within timeout
- ✅ **Button Response**: Button responds to click within 2 seconds
- ✅ **State Validation**: Correct UI state after interaction
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing elements

## Integration with Development Workflow

### CI/CD Compatible
- **Exit Codes**: 0 for success, 1 for failure
