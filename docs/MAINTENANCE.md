# Documentation Maintenance Guide

## Update Procedures

### 1. Documentation Updates
Always follow this procedure when updating documentation:

1. **Update changelog.md** when making changes
2. **Validate all internal links** after updates
3. **Regenerate diagrams** when architecture changes
4. **Update API documentation** with code changes
5. **Test all code examples** before publishing
6. **Review cross-references** for accuracy

### 2. File Organization Standards
- Keep all markdown files in `docs/` directory
- Use lowercase with underscores for filenames (e.g., `component_name_readme.md`)
- Place diagrams in `docs/diagrams/` subdirectory
- Maintain thesis documents in `docs/thesis_report/` subdirectory

### 3. Link Validation Process
```bash
# Manual link checking procedure
cd docs/
grep -r "docs/new_documentation/" .  # Check for broken links
grep -r "\[.*\](" . | grep -v "http"  # Find all internal links
```

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing any documentation changes, verify:

- [ ] All links functional and pointing to existing files
- [ ] Code examples tested and working
- [ ] Diagrams current and accurate
- [ ] Spelling and grammar checked
- [ ] Cross-references validated
- [ ] Table of contents updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout
- [ ] Academic citation standards maintained

## Content Standards

### Academic Writing Style
- Use clear, concise language matching thesis-level quality
- Maintain professional tone throughout
- Include proper citations where applicable
- Follow established academic formatting standards

### Technical Documentation Standards
- Include code examples where relevant
- Provide step-by-step procedures
- Add troubleshooting sections
- Reference related components and dependencies
- Maintain consistent terminology

### Visual Content Guidelines
- Use Mermaid diagrams for technical illustrations
- Maintain consistent styling across all diagrams
- Include alternative text descriptions for accessibility
- Store high-resolution versions in appropriate formats

## Automated Checks

### Planned Automation Scripts
Future automation tools to be implemented:

- **Link validation**: `scripts/validate_docs_links.py`
- **Diagram generation**: `scripts/generate_diagrams.py`
- **API sync**: `scripts/sync_api_docs.py`
- **Spell checking**: Integration with automated spell checkers
- **Format validation**: Markdown linting and formatting checks

### Current Manual Verification
Until automation is implemented, manually verify:

1. **Link integrity**: Check all internal and external links
2. **Code accuracy**: Test all provided code examples
3. **Diagram currency**: Ensure diagrams match current architecture
4. **Cross-references**: Validate all document cross-references

## Version Control Guidelines

### Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages for documentation changes:
```
docs: update Android application setup guide
docs: fix broken links in networking protocol
docs: add troubleshooting section to calibration system
```

### Branch Strategy
- Create feature branches for major documentation updates
- Use pull requests for review of significant changes
- Maintain clean commit history with logical groupings

### File History
- Keep track of major changes in changelog.md
- Document breaking changes or structural modifications
- Archive outdated documentation rather than deleting

## Review Process

### Content Review
1. **Technical accuracy**: Verify all technical information is current
2. **Completeness**: Ensure all required sections are present
3. **Clarity**: Check for clear, understandable explanations
4. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent style and terminology

### Peer Review
- Have technical content reviewed by subject matter experts
- Include usability testing for user-facing guides
- Validate examples and procedures with fresh installations

## Maintenance Schedule

### Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Check for new broken links
- [ ] Review and update TODO items
- [ ] Validate recent code changes against documentation

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Full link validation sweep
- [ ] Update diagram accuracy
- [ ] Review and update API documentation
- [ ] Assess documentation completeness gaps

### Quarterly Tasks
- [ ] Comprehensive content review
- [ ] User feedback incorporation
- [ ] Major structural improvements
- [ ] Archive outdated content

## Documentation Metrics

Track these metrics to ensure documentation quality:

- **Link health**: Percentage of working internal links
- **Content freshness**: Age of last updates for each document
- **Completeness**: Coverage of all system components
- **User feedback**: Issues and suggestions from users

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Broken Links
- Use find/replace to update systematic link changes
- Validate links after any file moves or renames
- Maintain redirect mapping for changed file locations

### Inconsistent Formatting
- Use consistent markdown formatting throughout
- Maintain standardized heading structures
- Follow established citation and reference formats

### Outdated Content
- Regular review cycles to identify stale information
- Clear deprecation notices for outdated procedures
- Migration guides for significant changes
