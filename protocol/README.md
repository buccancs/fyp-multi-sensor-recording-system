# Communication Protocol Module

## Overview

The Communication Protocol module defines and implements the standardized JSON socket protocol that serves as the communication backbone for the multi-sensor recording system, providing reliable inter-device communication based on established networking standards and distributed systems principles [Tanenbaum2016, Coulouris2011]. This module ensures consistent, extensible, and reliable communication across all system components while maintaining the precision and reliability required for scientific research applications.

The protocol implementation follows RESTful design principles [Fielding2000] and message-oriented middleware patterns [Hohpe2003] to provide a robust communication framework that supports complex multi-device coordination while maintaining simplicity and extensibility essential for research software development and maintenance.

## Architecture

The Protocol module implements a layered communication architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Message Definition Layer**: JSON schema definitions with validation and type safety ensuring message consistency and protocol compliance
- **Protocol Logic Layer**: Communication protocol implementation with state management and flow control procedures
- **Transport Abstraction Layer**: Transport-independent protocol design supporting multiple underlying communication mechanisms
- **Error Handling Layer**: Comprehensive error detection and recovery procedures ensuring communication reliability
