# Network Module

## Overview

The Network module implements sophisticated socket communication and protocol handling for the multi-sensor recording system, providing the distributed communication infrastructure that enables coordinated data collection across heterogeneous sensor platforms [Tanenbaum2016, Coulouris2011]. This module realizes the JSON socket protocol architecture that forms the backbone of the PC master-controller system.

The implementation follows established networking principles and distributed systems design patterns [Stevens2013, Fielding2000] to ensure reliable, low-latency communication suitable for real-time scientific data collection applications requiring microsecond-level temporal precision [Mills1991, IEEE1588-2008].

## Architecture

The network architecture implements a hybrid client-server model with the PC controller serving as the central coordination hub while maintaining support for peer-to-peer communication between devices when needed. The design follows the principle of graceful degradation, ensuring continued operation even when individual network connections experience intermittent failures [Saltzer1984].
