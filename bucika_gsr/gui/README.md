# GUI Module

## Overview

The GUI module provides PyQt5-based graphical user interface components for the multi-sensor recording system, implementing modern human-computer interaction principles [Nielsen1993, Shneiderman2016] to deliver an intuitive desktop application interface for scientific data collection and system monitoring.

This module represents the primary user interface layer of the PC master-controller, providing researchers with comprehensive control over distributed multi-sensor recording sessions while maintaining usability standards appropriate for scientific research environments [Norman2013].

## Architecture

The GUI architecture follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern [Gamma1994], ensuring clear separation of concerns between data presentation, user interaction, and business logic. The implementation leverages PyQt5's signal-slot mechanism for event-driven programming, providing responsive user experience during real-time data collection operations [Summerfield2007].

## Components

### Primary Interface Elements

The module encompasses comprehensive interface components designed for scientific research applications:

- **Main application windows** - Primary workspace implementing tabbed interface design with dockable panels for flexible workflow adaptation
- **Control panels and dialogs** - Device configuration interfaces following progressive disclosure principles [Nielsen1993] to manage complexity
- **Real-time data visualization** - Live sensor data plotting using matplotlib and pyqtgraph frameworks for scientific visualization [Hunter2007, Campagnola2013]
- **Device status displays** - Real-time monitoring interfaces providing immediate feedback on sensor connectivity and data quality
- **Recording controls** - Session management interface with intuitive start/stop/pause controls and progress monitoring
- **Settings interfaces** - Configuration management dialogs supporting research reproducibility through documented parameter specifications [Wilson2014]
- **Progress indicators** - Visual feedback systems providing real-time information on recording session status and completion
- **Error message dialogs** - User-friendly error reporting following graceful error handling principles [Cooper2014]

### User Experience Design

The interface design prioritizes scientific research workflow requirements while maintaining accessibility standards [WCAG2018]:

- **Workflow-Oriented Organization**: Interface layout follows research session lifecycle from setup through data export
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate visual confirmation of system status and data collection quality
- **Error Prevention**: Input validation and confirmation dialogs preventing accidental data loss
- **Accessibility Compliance**: High contrast modes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility

## Key Features

### Scientific Research Interface

- **Real-time data visualization** - Scientific plotting capabilities with customizable charts, axes scaling, and export functionality for research documentation
- **Intuitive recording controls** - Streamlined session management with one-click recording initiation and comprehensive progress monitoring
- **Device management interface** - Centralized device discovery, configuration, and status monitoring for multi-sensor coordination
- **Settings and configuration panels** - Research parameter management with validation and documentation support
- **Progress monitoring displays** - Real-time visualization of recording session progress, data quality metrics, and system performance
- **User-friendly error reporting** - Comprehensive error handling with actionable recovery suggestions and detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Advanced Capabilities

- **Multi-Device Coordination**: Centralized control interface for managing multiple Android devices and USB sensors simultaneously
- **Quality Assurance Integration**: Real-time data quality monitoring with automated alerts and validation procedures
- **Session Management**: Complete recording session lifecycle management with metadata tracking and export capabilities
- **Calibration Workflows**: Guided calibration procedures with quality assessment and validation feedback

## Implementation Standards

### Software Engineering Practices

The GUI module implementation follows established software engineering best practices [McConnell2004, Martin2008]:

- **Modular Architecture**: Component-based design enabling independent testing and maintenance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with graceful degradation and user feedback
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering and event handling for responsive real-time interfaces
- **Code Quality**: Consistent coding standards with comprehensive documentation and testing coverage

### Research Environment Considerations

The interface design accounts for specific requirements of research environments:

- **Long Session Support**: Interface remains responsive during extended recording sessions (hours to days)
- **Multiple Participant Coordination**: Support for managing multiple simultaneous participants and devices
- **Data Integrity Assurance**: Visual confirmation of successful data collection and storage operations
- **Experimental Protocol Integration**: Interface elements supporting structured experimental procedures

## Usage

The GUI module provides the primary desktop interface for controlling and monitoring the multi-sensor recording system, offering an intuitive user experience for data collection operations while maintaining the precision and reliability required for scientific research applications.

### Typical Research Workflow

1. **System Initialization**: Device discovery and connection establishment through guided setup procedures
2. **Calibration Procedures**: Systematic calibration of cameras and sensors with quality validation
3. **Session Configuration**: Research protocol setup with parameter validation and documentation
4. **Data Collection**: Real-time monitoring of synchronized multi-sensor recording with quality assurance
5. **Data Export**: Session completion with automated data packaging and metadata generation
