## üîß Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL - TEST DISCOVERY ISSUES IDENTIFIED

**Critical Issues Discovered:**
- ‚ùå Test discovery not working for most test frameworks
- ‚ùå Robolectric tests not being found (44+ files affected)  
- ‚ùå Only 3/66 test files actually executing
- ‚ùå Previous "100% success rate" claim was completely inaccurate

**Progress Made:**
- ‚úÖ All compilation errors resolved (commit 3ee81f2)
- ‚úÖ Basic JUnit 5 test infrastructure working (3 tests passing)
- ‚úÖ Android tests building successfully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test framework configuration requires significant work

**Current Test Execution Status:**
- 3 tests executing and passing (SimpleInfrastructureTest)
- 0 tests discovered from Robolectric test suite (majority of tests)
- Test configuration needs detailed review and fixes
