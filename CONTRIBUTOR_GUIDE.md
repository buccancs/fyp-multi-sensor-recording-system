   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   # Run test suite to verify setup
   python run_evaluation_suite.py --quick
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Standards

The project maintains exceptional code quality through systematic improvements:

#### Quality Metrics
- **98.4% system reliability** under diverse failure conditions
- **99.3% error recovery success rate** for handled exceptions  
- **97.8% data integrity preservation** during failure scenarios
- **>95% test coverage** for critical components

#### Code Standards
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use type hints, maintain <100 lines per function
- **Kotlin**: Follow Android coding standards, use clean MVVM architecture
- **Documentation**: Academic writing standards for Master's level research

### Testing Requirements

#### Before Making Changes
```bash
# Run foundation tests
python run_evaluation_suite.py --category foundation --quick

python scripts/tech_debt_audit.py --category python
flake8 PythonApp/ --count --statistics
```

#### After Making Changes
```bash
# Run integration tests
python run_evaluation_suite.py --category integration

# Complete evaluation before PRs
python run_evaluation_suite.py --parallel
```

## Architecture Guidelines

### Component-First Approach
- Focus on self-contained, well-documented modules
- Reference established architecture (PC master-controller, offline-first recording)
- Maintain consistency with distributed systems approach

### Clean Architecture
The Android application follows clean MVVM patterns:
- **RecordingSessionController**: Pure recording operation management
- **DeviceConnectionManager**: Device connectivity orchestration  
- **FileTransferManager**: Data transfer operations
- **CalibrationManager**: Calibration process coordination

## Coding Standards

### Python Code
```python
# Good: Type hints, clear naming, reasonable length
def calibrate_cameras(
    rgb_images: List[np.ndarray], 
    thermal_images: List[np.ndarray]
) -> CalibrationResult:
    """Calibrate RGB and thermal cameras using provided images."""
    # Implementation...
```

### Kotlin Code
```kotlin
// Good: Clean architecture, reactive patterns
class RecordingSessionController @Inject constructor(
    private val logger: Logger
) {
    private val _recordingState = MutableStateFlow<RecordingState>(RecordingState.Idle)
    val recordingState: StateFlow<RecordingState> = _recordingState.asStateFlow()
}
```

### Documentation Standards
- Start with clear overview and context
- Include code examples and API references  
- Follow academic citation format for research references
- Maintain consistency with established terminology

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Run Complete Test Suite**
   ```bash
   python run_evaluation_suite.py
   ```

2. **Check Code Quality**
   ```bash
   python scripts/tech_debt_audit.py --report
   black PythonApp/
   isort PythonApp/
   ```

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Update relevant documentation for changes
   - Add examples for new features
   - Update API documentation if interfaces change
