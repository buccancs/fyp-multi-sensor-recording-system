# Controllers Component

## Overview

The Controllers component represents the core control layer of the Android mobile application within the multi-sensor recording system, implementing controller patterns based on established software architecture principles [Gamma1994, Fowler2002]. This component coordinates sensor data collection, device communication, and user interface interactions while maintaining the separation of concerns essential for maintainable and testable code.

The implementation follows Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Command patterns to provide centralized control logic that orchestrates complex multi-sensor recording operations while ensuring responsive user experience and reliable data collection [Martin2008, Beck2004].

## Architecture

The Controllers component implements a hierarchical control architecture with specialized controllers for different functional domains:

- **Main Controller**: Central coordination of application lifecycle and component orchestration
- **Sensor Controllers**: Specialized controllers for camera, thermal, and physiological sensor management
- **Communication Controllers**: Network communication and protocol handling with PC master-controller
- **Session Controllers**: Recording session lifecycle management and state coordination

## Purpose

This component provides essential control functionality within the distributed multi-sensor recording system architecture, serving as the coordination layer that enables:

- **Centralized Control Logic**: Unified control interface for complex multi-sensor operations following single responsibility principle
- **State Management**: Comprehensive application state coordination with consistent state transitions and error handling
- **Event Coordination**: Event-driven programming model enabling responsive user interface and real-time sensor management
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and recovery procedures ensuring system reliability during critical recording operations

## Structure
