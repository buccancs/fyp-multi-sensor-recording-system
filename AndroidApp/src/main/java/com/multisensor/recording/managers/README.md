# Managers Component

## Overview

The Managers component implements the core management layer for the Android mobile application within the multi-sensor recording system, providing resource management and coordination services based on established software architecture patterns [Fowler2002, Evans2003]. This component encapsulates the complex logic required to manage sensor resources, device connections, and data flow coordination while maintaining system reliability and performance.

The implementation follows the Manager pattern and Service Layer architectural patterns, providing centralized management services that abstract the complexity of multi-sensor coordination while ensuring proper resource lifecycle management and error handling essential for research-grade applications.

## Architecture

The Managers component implements a hierarchical management architecture with specialized managers for different resource domains:

- **Session Manager**: Complete session lifecycle management with state coordination and quality assurance
- **Device Manager**: Hardware device management including connection lifecycle and capability negotiation  
- **Sensor Manager**: Multi-sensor coordination with temporal synchronization and data quality monitoring
- **Communication Manager**: Network communication management with protocol handling and error recovery
- **Storage Manager**: Data persistence management with integrity verification and metadata tracking

## Purpose

This component provides essential management functionality within the distributed multi-sensor recording system architecture, serving as the coordination layer that enables:

- **Resource Management**: Systematic management of hardware resources including cameras, sensors, and network connections following resource management patterns
- **Service Coordination**: Centralized coordination of application services with dependency management and lifecycle control
