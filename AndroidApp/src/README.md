# Android Application Source Code

Source code directory for the Android mobile application. This directory contains all application code, resources, and assets.

## Structure

- **main/** - Primary application code and resources
- **test/** - Unit test code for application components
- **androidTest/** - Android instrumentation and integration tests

## Components

The source directory is organized into:
- Application logic and controllers
- User interface components
- Sensor data collection modules
- Network communication implementations
- Data storage and persistence
- Testing frameworks and test cases

## Development

This follows standard Android project structure with separate directories for main application code, unit tests, and Android-specific instrumentation tests. The code implements the mobile client portion of the multi-sensor recording system.
