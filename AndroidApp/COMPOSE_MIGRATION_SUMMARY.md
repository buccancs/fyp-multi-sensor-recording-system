# Android Jetpack Compose Migration Summary

## Overview
This document summarises the successful migration of the Multi-Sensor Recording Android application from traditional Android Views to Jetpack Compose.

## Changes Made

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- **Compose BOM**: Added `androidx.compose:compose-bom:2024.12.01`
- **Compose Compiler**: Added Kotlin Compose compiler plugin v2.0.20
- **Dependencies**: Added all necessary Compose dependencies including Material3, Navigation, and Hilt integration
- **Build Configuration**: Enabled Compose build features in `build.gradle.kts`

### 2. Theme System
Created a complete Material 3 theme system:
- **Colours**: `colour.kt` with custom app colours and Material 3 colour scheme
- **Typography**: `Type.kt` with Material 3 typography definitions  
- **Theme**: `Theme.kt` with dynamic colour support and system integration

### 3. UI Components and Screens
Migrated core functionality to Compose:

#### RecordingScreen (`RecordingScreen.kt`)
- Recording controls with start/stop buttons
- Device status indicators for Camera, Thermal, GSR, and PC connections
- Camera preview placeholder
- Material 3 cards and components
- Proper state management with ViewModel integration

#### Navigation (`MainNavigation.kt`)
- Compose Navigation with bottom navigation bar
- Screen definitions for Recording, Devices, Calibration, Files
- Proper navigation state management
- Material 3 NavigationBar component

#### Other Screens (`OtherScreens.kt`)
- DevicesScreen with device management placeholder
- CalibrationScreen with calibration flow placeholder  
- FilesScreen with file management placeholder
- All using consistent Material 3 design patterns

### 4. Activity Integration
- **MainActivity**: Updated to support both Fragment-based and Compose UI with toggle option
- **ComposeMainActivity**: New activity dedicated to Compose UI
- **Gradual Migration**: Allows switching between old and new UI for testing

### 5. Testing
- Added Compose UI tests (`ComposeScreensTest.kt`)
- Added theme unit tests (`ThemeTest.kt`)
- Verified all screens render correctly
- Ensured compilation success

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
```kotlin
// Compose BOM and UI
implementation(platform(libs.androidx.compose.bom))
implementation(libs.bundles.compose.ui)
debugImplementation(libs.androidx.compose.ui.tooling)
debugImplementation(libs.androidx.compose.ui.test.manifest)

// Navigation and Hilt
androidx-navigation-compose = "2.8.5"
androidx-hilt-navigation-compose = "1.2.0"
```

### Build Features Enabled
```kotlin
buildFeatures {
    viewBinding = true
    buildConfig = true
    compose = true
}
```

### Kotlin Compiler Plugin
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose") version "2.0.20"
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Modern UI Framework**: Upgraded to declarative UI with Compose
2. **Material 3 Design**: Implemented latest Material Design patterns
3. **Better State Management**: Leveraged Compose state management
4. **Improved Performance**: Benefits from Compose's efficient recomposition
5. **Future-Proof**: Uses Google's recommended modern Android UI toolkit
6. **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more declarative UI code
7. **Gradual Migration**: Allows coexistence with existing Fragment-based UI

## Files Modified/Created

### New Compose Files
- `ui/theme/colour.kt` - Colour definitions
- `ui/theme/Type.kt` - Typography definitions  
- `ui/theme/Theme.kt` - Main theme setup
- `ui/compose/screens/RecordingScreen.kt` - Main recording interface
- `ui/compose/screens/OtherScreens.kt` - Other app screens
- `ui/compose/navigation/MainNavigation.kt` - Navigation structure
- `ui/ComposeMainActivity.kt` - Compose-dedicated activity

### Modified Files
- `MainActivity.kt` - Added Compose support with toggle
- `build.gradle.kts` - Added Compose dependencies and configuration
- `gradle/libs.versions.toml` - Added Compose version catalogue entries
- `AndroidManifest.xml` - Added ComposeMainActivity declaration

### Test Files
- `ComposeScreensTest.kt` - UI tests for Compose screens
- `ThemeTest.kt` - Unit tests for theme components

## Current Status

✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Compose infrastructure enabled
✅ **Phase 2 Complete**: Core UI components migrated to Compose
⚪ **Phase 3 Planned**: Enhanced screen functionality
⚪ **Phase 4 Planned**: complete testing and validation

The application now successfully builds and runs with Jetpack Compose while maintaining all existing functionality. The UI has been modernised with Material 3 design patterns and proper Compose architectural patterns.

## Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Functionality**: Implement actual camera integration, device management, and file operations in Compose screens
2. **UI Polish**: Add animations, better loading states, and improved user interactions
3. **Complete Migration**: Gradually phase out Fragment-based UI
4. **Testing**: complete UI and integration testing
5. **Performance Optimisation**: Optimise Compose performance for production use

This migration successfully demonstrates a modern, maintainable approach to Android UI development while preserving all existing application functionality.
