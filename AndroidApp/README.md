# Streamlined Multi-Sensor Recording App

## Overview

This is a completely rebuilt, streamlined version of the Android multi-sensor recording application. Built from the ground up with a focus on core IRCamera functionality, this app provides a clean, minimal implementation for capturing data from multiple sensors simultaneously.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Simplicity**: Removed complex dependency injection, extensive UI frameworks, and sophisticated state management
- **IRCamera Focus**: Core implementation based on IRCamera functionality for thermal imaging
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential Android libraries, no heavy frameworks
- **Direct Implementation**: Straightforward code without unnecessary abstractions

- **Middle Section**: Recording controls with timer
- **Lower Section**: Device connection status cards

## 🔄 Comparison with Original App

### Original App (AndroidApp_backup)
- **Lines of Code**: ~50,000+ lines
- **Dependencies**: 40+ libraries including Hilt DI, Compose, Firebase, etc.
- **Architecture**: Complex MVVM with dependency injection
- **Features**: Extensive UI, analytics, cloud sync, calibration, etc.

### Streamlined App (AndroidApp)
- **Lines of Code**: ~2,300 lines
- **Dependencies**: 15 essential libraries only
- **Architecture**: Direct implementation, no DI framework
- **Features**: Core recording functionality with real SDK integration

**Code Reduction**: ~95% reduction in complexity while maintaining core functionality and adding production-ready implementations

## 🛠️ Development

### Build Requirements
- Android Studio 2024.1+
