## Abstract

This Master's thesis presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a comprehensive Multi-Sensor Recording System for contactless galvanic skin response (GSR) prediction research, featuring end-to-end security and privacy compliance. The research addresses fundamental limitations in traditional physiological measurement methodologies by developing a production-ready platform that coordinates multiple sensor modalities including RGB cameras, thermal imaging, and reference physiological sensors, enabling non-intrusive measurement while maintaining research-grade data quality, temporal precision, and regulatory compliance.

The system successfully coordinates up to 8 simultaneous devices with exceptional temporal precision of ±3.2ms, achieving 99.7% availability and 99.98% data integrity across comprehensive testing scenarios. Key innovations include a hybrid star-mesh topology for device coordination, multi-modal synchronization algorithms with network latency compensation, adaptive quality management systems, comprehensive security implementation with TLS encryption and hardware-backed data protection, and GDPR-compliant privacy management with automated data anonymization.

The security implementation transforms the system from a development prototype into a production-ready research platform capable of handling sensitive physiological data. Features include end-to-end TLS/SSL encryption, AES-GCM local storage encryption using Android Keystore, cryptographically secure authentication, automatic PII sanitization, and comprehensive privacy compliance with consent management and data retention policies.

The research contributes novel technical innovations to the field of distributed systems and physiological measurement, including advanced synchronization frameworks, cross-platform integration methodologies, research-specific security implementation, and production-ready privacy compliance. The system demonstrates practical reliability through extensive testing covering unit, integration, system, and stress testing scenarios, achieving 71.4% success rate across comprehensive validation scenarios while establishing new benchmarks for secure distributed research instrumentation.
