# Cleanup Test Data

Test data for validating system cleanup operations and resource management in the multi-sensor recording system. This directory contains data from tests that validate proper cleanup and resource deallocation.

## Contents

This test data includes:
- Resource cleanup validation data
- Memory management test results
- System state cleanup verification
- Resource deallocation testing
- Cleanup operation performance metrics
- System recovery validation data

## Test Scenarios

Cleanup tests validate:
- Proper resource deallocation after sessions
- Memory cleanup and garbage collection
- Network connection cleanup
- File system resource management
- Device disconnection handling
- System state reset procedures

## Usage

This cleanup test data is used for:
- Validating proper resource management
- Testing memory leak prevention
- Verifying system state cleanup
- Resource deallocation validation
- System stability after cleanup operations
- Long-term system reliability testing

The data ensures that the multi-sensor recording system properly manages resources and maintains stability through multiple session cycles and cleanup operations.
