# Calibration Data

Calibration test data and session files for the multi-sensor recording system. This directory contains calibration data used for testing, validation, and system setup.

## Contents

This directory includes various calibration test sessions:
- **multi_device_test/** - Multi-device calibration test data
- **test_calibration_session/** - Standard calibration session data
- **test_session/** - General test session recordings
- **integration_test/** - Integration testing calibration data
- **another_session/** - Additional calibration session data
- **cleanup_test/** - Cleanup operation test data
- **concurrent_test/** - Concurrent operation test data
- **memory_test/** - Memory usage test calibration data

## Test Sessions

Each test session directory contains:
- Device-specific calibration data
- Sensor readings and measurements
- Calibration parameters and results
- Session metadata and logs
- Validation data for accuracy assessment

## Usage

This calibration data is used for:
- System calibration validation
- Algorithm development and testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Accuracy assessment
- Integration testing
- System demonstration

The data ensures proper system calibration and validates the accuracy of sensor measurements across multiple devices.
