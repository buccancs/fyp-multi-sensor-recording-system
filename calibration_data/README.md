# Calibration Data Repository

## Overview

The Calibration Data Repository contains comprehensive calibration test datasets and validation sessions for the multi-sensor recording system, providing essential reference data for system validation, algorithm development, and quality assurance procedures [Taylor1997, BIPM2019]. This repository supports research reproducibility and system validation by maintaining documented calibration sessions with known parameters and expected outcomes.

The calibration data follows established metrological standards and best practices for scientific data management [Wilson2014, Sandve2013], ensuring that system validation procedures can be independently verified and calibration algorithms can be systematically evaluated across diverse operational scenarios.
