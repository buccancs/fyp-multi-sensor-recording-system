# Test Session Data

General test session recordings and data for the multi-sensor recording system. This directory contains sample recording session data with multiple device configurations.

## Structure

- **device_1/** - Recording data from first device
- **device_2/** - Recording data from second device

## Contents

This test session includes:
- Multi-device recording session data
- Synchronized sensor readings
- Device-specific calibration data
- Session metadata and timing information
- Cross-device synchronization validation
- Recording quality assessment data

## Device Data

Each device directory contains:
- Sensor measurement recordings
- Device-specific configuration data
- Timing and synchronization logs
- Calibration parameters and results
- Performance metrics and statistics

## Usage

This test session data is used for:
- System functionality validation
- Multi-device synchronization testing
- Recording quality assessment
- Performance benchmarking
- Integration testing scenarios
- Development and debugging support

The data provides realistic test scenarios for validating the multi-sensor recording system's ability to coordinate and synchronize data collection across multiple connected devices.
