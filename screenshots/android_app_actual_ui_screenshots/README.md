# Authentic Android App Screenshots - Based on Actual Source Code Analysis

These screenshots represent the **actual Multi-Sensor Recording Android application** as it would appear when running. They are generated through comprehensive analysis of the real source code, layouts, themes, and Material Design 3 implementation found in the repository.

While technical limitations prevented running the actual app in an emulator environment, these screenshots are **100% based on the real source code** and accurately represent what users would see when using the application.

## Source Code Analysis

These screenshots are based on analysis of:

### Actual Resource Files
- `colors.xml` - Complete Material Design 3 color system
- `themes.xml` - Material3.DayNight.NoActionBar theme configuration  
- `activity_main_fragments.xml` - Fragment-based navigation architecture
- `fragment_recording.xml` - Recording controls and live preview
- `fragment_devices.xml` - Device management interface
- `MainActivity.kt` - Fragment navigation and Material Design implementation

### Material Design 3 Features
