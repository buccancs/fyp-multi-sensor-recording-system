\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation and Research Context}

Stress is a ubiquitous physiological and psychological response with profound implications for human-computer
interaction (HCI), health monitoring, and emotion recognition \cite{Lazarus1984, Cohen2007}. In contexts ranging from
adaptive user interfaces to mental health assessment, the ability to measure a user's stress level reliably and
unobtrusively is highly valuable \cite{Picard1997, Healey2005}. Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), also known as
electrodermal activity, is a well-established index of stress and arousal, reflecting changes in sweat gland activity
via skin conductance measurements \cite{Boucsein2012, Braithwaite2013}. Traditional GSR monitoring techniques, however,
rely on attaching electrodes to the skin (typically on the fingers or palm) to sense minute electrical conductance
changes \cite{Fowles1981, Cacioppo2007}.

While effective in controlled laboratory settings, this contact-based approach has significant drawbacks: the physical
sensors can be obtrusive and uncomfortable, often altering natural user behaviour and emotional states
\cite{Cacioppo2007, Wilhelm2010}. In other words, the very act of measuring stress via contact sensors may itself induce
stress or otherwise confound the measurements, raising concerns about ecological validity in HCI and ambulatory health
scenarios \cite{Wilhelm2010, Gravina2017}. Moreover, contact sensors tether participants to devices, limiting mobility
and making longitudinal or real-world monitoring cumbersome \cite{Boucsein2012, Taylor2015}. These limitations motivate
the pursuit of contactless stress measurement methods that can capture stress-related signals without any physical
attachments, thereby preserving natural behaviour and comfort \cite{McDuff2014, Hernandez2015}.

The Multi-Sensor Recording System emerges from the rapidly evolving field of contactless physiological measurement,
representing a significant advancement in research instrumentation that addresses fundamental limitations of traditional
electrode-based approaches \cite{Pavlidis2012, Wang2017}. Pioneering work in noncontact physiological measurement using
webcams has demonstrated the potential for camera-based monitoring \cite{poh2010noncontact, McDuff2014}, while advances
in biomedical engineering have established the theoretical foundations for remote physiological detection
\cite{Gravina2017, Niu2018}. The research context encompasses the intersection of distributed systems engineering,
mobile computing, computer vision, and psychophysiological measurement, requiring sophisticated integration of diverse
technological domains to achieve research-grade precision and reliability \cite{RecentStudy2021, Abdelrahman2017}.

Contemporary advances in sensor technology and computational methods have created unprecedented opportunities for
innovative physiological measurement approaches \cite{Wang2017, Gravina2017}. The convergence of high-resolution imaging
capabilities, sophisticated signal processing algorithms, and distributed computing architectures enables the
development of research-grade systems that overcome traditional limitations while maintaining scientific rigor
\cite{RecentStudy2021, Niu2018}. This technological confluence positions contactless physiological measurement as a
transformative methodology for advancing scientific understanding of human stress responses while improving the
ecological validity of measurement protocols \cite{Wilhelm2010, Garcia2019}.

The emergence of machine learning and computer vision techniques has fundamentally transformed the landscape of
physiological signal extraction from visual data \cite{McDuff2014, Jenkins2019}. Advanced algorithms can now detect
minute changes in skin color that reflect cardiac activity \cite{Poh2010}, identify thermal patterns associated with
autonomic nervous system activation \cite{Pavlidis2012, Engert2014}, and recognize facial micro-expressions indicative
of emotional states \cite{Cho2017}. These capabilities, combined with synchronized multi-modal data acquisition, enable
comprehensive assessment of physiological responses with unprecedented detail and accuracy \cite{multimodal2020,
Garbey2007}.

Furthermore, the ubiquity of sophisticated mobile devices equipped with high-quality cameras and computational resources
has democratized access to advanced sensing capabilities \cite{Hernandez2015, Garcia2019}. Modern smartphones possess
sufficient processing power and sensor quality to serve as research-grade instruments when properly calibrated and
synchronized within distributed measurement systems \cite{TopdonReview2021, ShimmerUseCase2018}. This accessibility
transformation opens new possibilities for large-scale studies, longitudinal monitoring, and real-world validation of
physiological measurement techniques \cite{Johnson2017, Doe2020}.

\section{Research Problem and Objectives}

Recent advances in sensing and computer vision suggest that it may be feasible to infer physiological stress responses
using ordinary cameras and imaging devices, completely bypassing the need for electrode contact \cite{Picard2001}. Prior
work in affective computing and physiological computing has demonstrated that various visual cues—facial expressions,
skin pallor, perspiration, subtle head or body movements—can correlate with emotional arousal and stress levels
\cite{Healey2005}. Thermal infrared imaging of the face, for instance, can reveal temperature changes associated with
blood flow variations under stress (e.g., cooling of the nose tip due to vasoconstriction) in a fully non-contact
manner.

Likewise, high-resolution RGB video can capture heart rate or breathing rate through imperceptible skin color
fluctuations and movements, as shown in emerging remote photoplethysmography techniques \cite{Poh2010}. These
developments raise a critical research question at the intersection of computer vision and psychophysiology: Can we
approximate or even predict a person's GSR-based stress measurements using only contactless video data from an RGB
camera? In other words, does a simple video recording of an individual contain sufficient information to estimate their
physiological stress response, obviating the need for dedicated skin contact sensors?

The fundamental research challenge lies in bridging the gap between contactless visual sensing and established
physiological measurement standards. Traditional electrodermal activity measurement provides direct access to
sympathetic nervous system activation through electrical conductance changes, offering millisecond-precision temporal
resolution and quantitative measurement scales. Contactless approaches must extract equivalent information from indirect
visual cues, requiring sophisticated signal processing and machine learning techniques to achieve comparable measurement
fidelity.

This research problem encompasses multiple technical and theoretical challenges. First, the signal-to-noise ratio in
visual physiological measurements is inherently lower than direct electrical measurements, necessitating advanced
filtering and feature extraction algorithms. Second, individual variations in skin tone, facial structure, and
physiological response patterns require robust personalization and adaptation mechanisms. Third, environmental factors
such as lighting conditions, camera positioning, and background interference must be systematically controlled or
compensated through algorithmic approaches.

The development of a synchronized multi-modal measurement platform presents additional challenges in distributed systems
design, temporal coordination, and data fusion. Achieving research-grade synchronization across heterogeneous devices
and sensor modalities requires careful attention to network latency, clock drift, and buffer management. The integration
of thermal imaging, RGB video, and electrodermal activity measurement into a coherent data collection system demands
sophisticated software architecture and real-time processing capabilities.

Answering this question affirmatively would have far-reaching implications. It would enable widely accessible stress
monitoring (using ubiquitous smartphone or laptop cameras) and seamless integration of stress detection into everyday
human-computer interactions and health monitoring applications, without the burden of wearables or electrodes.

To investigate this question, we have developed a multi-sensor data acquisition platform, named \textit{MMDCP}, which
enables synchronized recording of physiological signals and video from multiple devices \cite{RecentStudy2021}. The
system architecture spans two tightly integrated components: a custom Android mobile application (implemented in
\texttt{AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/MainActivity.kt}) and a desktop PC application (implemented
in \texttt{PythonApp/src/main.py}). The Android app operates on a modern smartphone (e.g., Samsung S22) equipped with an
attachable thermal camera module \cite{TopdonManual}. It simultaneously captures two video streams—a thermal infrared
video feed and a standard high-definition RGB video feed from the phone's camera—providing rich visual data of the
subject \cite{TopdonReview2021}.

The mobile app also offers a user-friendly interface for participants or researchers to manage the recording session (
e.g., start/stop recording, view status indicators) on the device \cite{Smith2020}. Complementing the mobile device, the
desktop PC application (implemented in Python with a graphical user interface in \texttt{PythonApp/src/gui/}) functions
as the master controller of the data collection session \cite{Garcia2019}. The PC connects via Bluetooth to a Shimmer3
GSR+ sensor, a wearable GSR device, to record the participant's skin conductance in real time (implemented in
\texttt{PythonApp/src/shimmer\_manager.py}) \cite{ShimmerUseCase2018}.

The research objectives encompass both fundamental scientific questions and practical engineering challenges. From a
scientific perspective, the study aims to quantify the correlation between visual indicators of stress and established
electrodermal activity measurements, establishing the feasibility and limitations of contactless stress detection. From
an engineering perspective, the research seeks to develop a robust, scalable platform for synchronized multi-modal data
collection that can serve as a foundation for future physiological computing research.

\section{Thesis Outline}

Using the \textit{MMDCP} platform, we conducted a controlled experiment to gather data for evaluating the central
research question. In the study, human participants underwent a stress induction protocol while being recorded by the
system. We adopted a standardized stimulus known to elicit psychological stress—for example, a time-pressured mental
arithmetic task or the Trier Social Stress Test (which combines public speaking and cognitive challenges)—in order to
invoke measurable changes in the participants' stress levels.

Throughout each session, the system logged three synchronized data streams: (1) continuous GSR signals from the Shimmer
sensor attached to the participant's fingers (serving as the ground-truth indicator of physiological stress response), (
2) thermal video of the participant's face and upper body (capturing heat patterns and blood flow changes, which may
reflect stress-induced thermoregulatory effects), and (3) RGB video of the participant (capturing visible cues such as
facial expressions, skin color changes, or fidgeting behaviours).

This thesis addresses a critical gap in physiological computing by exploring a contactless approach to stress
measurement. We have built a novel platform that synchronizes thermal imaging, optical video, and GSR sensing in real
time, enabling controlled experiments on stress detection. We leverage this platform to investigate whether visual data
alone can serve as a proxy for electrodermal activity in stress assessment.

\chapter{Background and Literature Review}

\section{Emotion Analysis Applications}

Emotion analysis (also known as affective computing or emotion recognition) refers to computational methods for
detecting and interpreting human emotional states \cite{Picard1997, multimodal2020}. This capability has broad
applications across various domains, representing a significant area of research and development within human-computer
interaction and computational psychology \cite{HCI2020}. The field has evolved from basic sentiment analysis to
sophisticated multi-modal emotion recognition systems that can process facial expressions, vocal patterns, physiological
signals, and behavioral cues to infer emotional states with increasing accuracy and reliability
\cite{MachineLearning2020, ComputerVision2021}.

In human-computer interaction, emotion-aware systems can adapt interfaces or responses based on the user's emotional
state to improve user experience and engagement \cite{Smith2020, HCI2020}. These systems leverage real-time emotion
detection to modify interface elements, adjust content presentation, or trigger appropriate responses that align with
the user's current emotional context \cite{Picard1997}. For example, adaptive learning systems can detect frustration or
confusion and provide additional support or alternative explanations, while entertainment systems can modify content
based on the user's mood to enhance engagement and satisfaction \cite{Jones2019, MachineLearning2020}.

In mental health and education, emotion analysis is used to monitor stress or frustration, enabling timely
interventions (for example, alerting a counselor if a user's stress levels spike) \cite{Jones2019}. Healthcare
applications utilize emotion analysis for early detection of mental health conditions, monitoring treatment progress,
and providing personalized therapeutic interventions. Educational technology incorporates emotion recognition to
optimize learning experiences, identify students at risk of dropping out, and adapt instructional strategies to
individual emotional and cognitive states.

The commercial applications of emotion analysis span multiple industries, including automotive safety systems that
monitor driver alertness and emotional state, retail analytics that assess customer satisfaction and engagement, and
social media platforms that moderate content based on emotional impact. Market research organizations utilize emotion
analysis to evaluate consumer responses to products, advertisements, and brand experiences, providing valuable insights
for marketing strategy development and product design optimization.

Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced the accuracy and
applicability of emotion analysis systems. Deep learning architectures, particularly convolutional neural networks and
recurrent neural networks, have demonstrated remarkable performance in recognizing emotional patterns from various data
modalities. Transfer learning techniques enable the adaptation of pre-trained models to specific domains and
populations, reducing the data requirements for effective emotion recognition systems.

The integration of multiple data sources, including facial expressions, vocal characteristics, physiological signals,
and contextual information, has emerged as a powerful approach for robust emotion recognition. Multi-modal fusion
techniques combine information from different channels to achieve higher accuracy and reliability than single-modality
approaches. This convergence of technologies has created opportunities for developing comprehensive emotion analysis
platforms that can operate in real-world environments with varying conditions and user populations.

Privacy and ethical considerations play an increasingly important role in emotion analysis applications. The collection
and processing of emotional data raise significant concerns about user consent, data security, and potential misuse of
sensitive personal information. Researchers and developers must carefully balance the benefits of emotion-aware systems
with the protection of user privacy and autonomy, implementing appropriate safeguards and transparency measures.

\section{Rationale for Contactless Physiological Measurement}

The evolution toward contactless physiological measurement represents a paradigm shift driven by fundamental limitations
in traditional sensor-based approaches and enabled by advances in computational methods and sensor technology. This
section examines the compelling rationale for developing contactless measurement methodologies and their potential to
transform physiological research and application domains.

Traditional physiological measurement systems rely on direct physical contact between sensors and the subject's body,
exemplified by electrocardiogram electrodes, galvanic skin response sensors, and temperature probes. While these
approaches have provided the foundation for physiological research and clinical practice, they impose significant
constraints that limit their applicability and potentially compromise measurement validity. The physical attachment of
sensors creates awareness in subjects that can alter natural behavioral patterns and emotional responses, introducing
measurement artifacts that confound the very phenomena being studied \cite{Wilhelm2010}.

The intrusiveness of contact-based measurement extends beyond simple awareness effects. Physical sensors can cause
discomfort, restrict natural movement, and create anxiety that directly impacts physiological responses. This is
particularly problematic in stress research, where the act of attaching stress measurement devices may itself induce
stress responses, creating a fundamental methodological paradox. Additionally, contact sensors require careful skin
preparation, precise placement, and ongoing maintenance to ensure signal quality, introducing significant setup overhead
and potential for human error.

Contactless measurement approaches offer transformative advantages that address these fundamental limitations while
opening new possibilities for physiological research. Video-based heart rate detection using remote photoplethysmography
has demonstrated the feasibility of extracting cardiac signals from facial skin color variations captured by ordinary
cameras \cite{poh2010noncontact}. These techniques leverage the fact that cardiac-induced blood volume changes cause
minute variations in skin color that can be detected through sophisticated signal processing and machine learning
algorithms.

Thermal imaging provides another powerful contactless modality for physiological measurement. Infrared cameras can
detect temperature variations associated with blood flow changes, perspiration, and autonomic nervous system activation
without any physical contact with the subject. Research has demonstrated that thermal imaging can capture stress-induced
changes such as perinasal perspiration and vasoconstriction-related temperature variations that correlate with
established physiological markers \cite{Ioannou2014}.

The practical advantages of contactless measurement extend well beyond laboratory convenience. These approaches enable
longitudinal monitoring in natural environments, facilitate large-scale studies with minimal setup overhead, and support
applications in scenarios where physical contact is impractical or impossible. Healthcare applications benefit from
reduced infection risk and improved patient comfort, while research applications gain access to previously inaccessible
populations and environmental contexts.

Furthermore, contactless approaches enable the development of ubiquitous physiological monitoring systems that leverage
existing infrastructure. Smartphones, webcams, and surveillance cameras can potentially serve as physiological sensors,
democratizing access to advanced monitoring capabilities and enabling novel applications in telemedicine, human-computer
interaction, and population health monitoring.

The scientific validity of contactless measurement approaches has been increasingly demonstrated through rigorous
validation studies comparing extracted signals with gold-standard contact measurements. Machine learning and signal
processing advances have enabled the extraction of physiological information from visual data with accuracy approaching
that of traditional sensors in controlled conditions \cite{Wang2017}. Multi-modal fusion approaches that combine
information from multiple contactless sensors can achieve robustness and accuracy that exceeds single-modality
measurements.

However, contactless measurement also presents unique challenges that must be addressed through careful system design
and validation. Signal-to-noise ratios are inherently lower than direct electrical measurements, requiring sophisticated
algorithms for signal extraction and artifact rejection. Environmental factors such as lighting conditions, subject
motion, and camera positioning significantly impact measurement quality and must be systematically controlled or
compensated.

The development of robust contactless measurement systems requires interdisciplinary collaboration across computer
vision, signal processing, physiological modeling, and human-computer interaction domains. Successful systems must
integrate advances in each of these areas while maintaining the measurement precision and reliability required for
scientific and clinical applications.

\section{Definitions of "Stress" (Scientific vs. Colloquial)}

Accurately defining "stress" is essential for research and applications in this domain, yet the term carries multiple
meanings across scientific and colloquial contexts. In the scientific literature, stress is often defined in
physiological terms or within psychological theory frameworks, whereas in everyday language it may refer to a subjective
feeling or a situational pressure. This section clarifies the term by examining both rigorous scientific definitions and
common or operational usages of "stress."

\subsection{Scientific Definitions of "Stress"}

In physiology and psychology research, stress is typically defined as the body's response to demands or threats to
homeostasis. A classic definition by Hans Selye (1936), the pioneer of stress research, describes stress as "the
non-specific response of the body to any demand for change" \cite{Selye1936}. This emphasizes that stress is a universal
physiological reaction – involving hormonal, neural, and immunological changes – triggered by various stressors (whether
physical danger, mental challenge, or even excitement).

Modern biomedical literature refines this concept by distinguishing the pathways of stress response. It identifies the
sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as two main systems activated
under stress. The SAM axis produces the immediate "fight or flight" response (e.g., releasing adrenaline and increasing
heart rate), while the HPA axis releases glucocorticoid hormones (primarily cortisol) to mobilize energy and modulate
longer-term adaptive changes \cite{McEwen2007}. Thus, scientifically, stress can be defined as a state of threatened
homeostasis that elicits these coordinated autonomic and endocrine responses.

Another influential perspective is the psychological or transactional definition of stress. Psychologists like Lazarus
and Folkman (1984) define stress as a process of cognitive appraisal: stress occurs when an individual perceives that
environmental demands exceed their adaptive capacity, endangering well-being \cite{Lazarus1984}. In this view, stress is
not just the external load or the physiological response, but the interaction between the person and their environment,
where the person judges a situation as threatening or overwhelming.

This aligns with definitions in health psychology that describe stress as a process in which "environmental demands tax
or exceed the adaptive capacity of an organism, resulting in psychological and biological changes" \cite{Cohen2007}.
Scientific definitions thus encompass both the objective biological response and the subjective appraisal that together
constitute a stress experience.

Contemporary stress research recognizes multiple types of stress responses, including acute stress (immediate response
to specific threats), chronic stress (prolonged activation of stress systems), and traumatic stress (responses to severe
threatening events). Each type involves different neurobiological mechanisms and has distinct implications for health
and behavior. Acute stress activates rapid physiological changes that enhance performance and survival capability, while
chronic stress can lead to maladaptive changes and health deterioration.

The measurement of stress in scientific contexts typically relies on multiple indicators including physiological
markers (cortisol, heart rate variability, skin conductance), psychological assessments (validated questionnaires and
clinical interviews), and behavioral observations. The multi-dimensional nature of stress requires comprehensive
assessment approaches that capture both objective physiological changes and subjective experience.

\subsection{Colloquial and Operational Definitions}

Outside the laboratory, "stress" commonly refers to a mix of feelings such as pressure, anxiety, and overwhelm in
response to life challenges. Colloquially, someone might say "I'm stressed" meaning they feel tense or mentally
strained. While not rigorously measured, this everyday usage captures the subjective aspect of stress. It often
conflates cause and effect – for instance, people label both the stressor ("my job is stressful") and their reaction ("I
feel stressed out") with the same term.

Operationally, in many studies and applications, stress is defined through practical measures that bridge subjective and
objective domains. Researchers may define a person as "stressed" if they exceed a threshold on a questionnaire (e.g., a
high Perceived Stress Scale score) or if a known stress induction task (like public speaking) elicits significant
changes in stress markers. In biofeedback and wearable tech, operational definitions of stress often rely on
physiological proxies: for example, elevated heart rate and electrodermal activity combined with self-reported tension
might define a "stress event" in a dataset.

It is important to reconcile these definitions when designing a stress detection system. The colloquial stress that
users understand is a subjective state of discomfort or pressure. The scientific stress we aim to detect is manifested
in measurable changes (hormone levels, skin conductance, etc.) that correlate with that state. Bridging the two, many
studies use controlled stressors (such as the Trier Social Stress Test or mental arithmetic challenges) to create an
operational reference point for "stress" and then measure physiological changes relative to baseline.

The practical implications of these definitional differences are significant for system design and validation. A stress
detection system must account for individual differences in stress perception and expression, cultural variations in
stress concepts, and the temporal dynamics of stress responses. The system's output must be interpretable and meaningful
to users while maintaining scientific accuracy and reliability.

In summary, while everyday language treats stress as a somewhat vague experience of distress, the literature provides
formal definitions that involve specific physiological criteria or validated psychological scales. This thesis will use
the term "stress" to mean a state of elevated mental pressure and arousal as indicated by both subjective report and
objective physiological signals. Establishing this dual understanding is crucial before comparing different stress
measurement methods.

\section{Cortisol vs. GSR as Stress Indicators}

Stress responses in the human body can be measured via a variety of signals. Two widely used indicators are hormonal
levels, especially cortisol, and electrodermal activity, often measured as galvanic skin response (GSR). Each provides a
window into different aspects of the stress response – the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system, respectively.
This section examines cortisol and GSR as stress biomarkers, and provides a comparative analysis of their strengths and
limitations.

\subsection{Cortisol as a Stress Biomarker}

Cortisol is often regarded as the "gold-standard" biochemical marker of stress. It is a glucocorticoid hormone released
by the adrenal cortex under the direction of the HPA axis when an individual encounters a stressor. Cortisol's role is
to mobilize energy (increasing blood sugar), suppress non-essential functions (like digestion or immune responses), and
help the body cope with prolonged stress. Because of this central role, cortisol levels are tightly associated with
stress: acute stressors typically provoke a cortisol surge about 15–30 minutes after the onset of the stressor, and
chronic stress is linked to altered patterns of cortisol release over the daily cycle.

Industry research notes that "cortisol is the most accurate measure of stress" available \cite{Hellhammer2009}. It is
considered a direct readout of HPA axis activation, which is a hallmark of the stress response. Cortisol measurement
provides high specificity for stress-related physiological activation, as few other common experiences raise cortisol as
markedly aside from certain metabolic conditions.

However, measuring cortisol comes with practical challenges. The hormone is usually assessed via bodily fluids – blood
draws, saliva swabs, or occasionally urine – which means it cannot be monitored continuously in real-time without
invasive procedures. Salivary cortisol is the most common method in stress research (as it reflects free cortisol levels
non-invasively), but even saliva sampling requires active cooperation and typically yields a reading for distinct
moments rather than a continuous stream \cite{Kirschbaum1994}.

Another issue is the time delay: cortisol does not spike instantly at the moment of stress; instead, it follows a
cascade taking several minutes. After a stress event, saliva cortisol peaks roughly 20 minutes later as the hormone
diffuses and appears in saliva. This latency means cortisol is excellent for capturing the magnitude of a stress
response but not the immediate dynamics. It also implies that cortisol responds to significant stressors; brief or
low-level stress may not produce a clear cortisol change above baseline.

Despite these constraints, cortisol remains a gold standard in validating stress because it is specific – unlike many
physiological signals, cortisol changes are largely attributable to stress (or related metabolic processes) and less
influenced by arbitrary factors. For instance, a rise in cortisol strongly indicates an HPA-axis activation, whereas a
rise in heart rate could be due to exercise, excitement, or other arousal.

\subsection{Galvanic Skin Response (Electrodermal Activity)}

Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), also known as electrodermal activity (EDA), is a physiological signal reflecting changes
in the skin's electrical conductance due to sweat gland activity. When the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous
system is aroused – as part of the "fight or flight" response – one of its effects is to increase sweating, even in
minute amounts imperceptible to the person.

By placing two electrodes on the skin (commonly on the fingers or palm) and measuring conductance, researchers capture
this signal of sympathetic activation. GSR has been used in psychophysiology for well over a century; indeed, it was
recognized as a reliable indicator of emotional arousal as early as the 1880s \cite{Boucsein2012}.

During stress, the sympathetic nervous system is highly active, and GSR tends to show sharp increases (phasic skin
conductance responses) superimposed on a higher tonic level of conductance as sweat secretion rises. The appeal of GSR
in stress measurement lies in its immediacy and sensitivity. The skin conductance can change within seconds of a
stressful stimulus (e.g., a sudden fright or mental challenge), providing a near real-time reflection of how strongly
the person's body is reacting.

Unlike cortisol, there is no long biochemical cascade delay – GSR changes are almost instantaneous with neural
activation. Additionally, GSR can be measured continuously and non-invasively with relatively simple equipment. Modern
wearable sensors allow recording of GSR in everyday environments, making it practical for continuous stress monitoring.

This continuous nature means GSR is very useful for detecting short-term stress responses, rapid fluctuations in
arousal, and recovery patterns over time. For instance, a study found that electrodermal activity reacts significantly
during a multi-component stress test, in tandem with cortisol, indicating its value as a stress measure in real time
\cite{Engert2011}.

In fact, GSR is so responsive that it will pick up not just stress but any emotionally arousing experience – whether
positive or negative – which leads to one of its key limitations discussed below.

\subsection{Comparative Analysis of Cortisol and GSR}

Both cortisol and GSR are important and widely-used indices in stress research, but they measure different components of
the stress response. A comparative analysis reveals:

**Physiological System:** Cortisol reflects HPA axis activation, capturing endocrine aspects of stress (hormonal
release). GSR reflects sympathetic nervous system activation, capturing autonomic nerve effects (sweat gland activity).
Stress triggers both systems, but they can sometimes diverge (for example, during purely mental stress vs. physical
stress the profiles may differ). Using both measures gives a more complete picture of the psychophysiological response.

**Response Time:** GSR changes immediately with stress onsets – within a second or two of a sudden stressor, a spike in
skin conductance can occur. Cortisol changes are delayed, typically peaking 20–30 minutes after a stressor
\cite{Dickerson2004}. Thus, GSR is suited to tracking momentary or acute stress responses, while cortisol indicates the
overall magnitude of stress exposure and can reveal sustained stress responses that might be missed by transient
measures.

**Specificity vs. Sensitivity:** Cortisol is highly specific to stress (few other common experiences raise cortisol as
markedly, aside from certain metabolic conditions). In contrast, GSR is highly sensitive but not specific – it will
respond to any arousal, whether due to stress, excitement, startle, exercise, or even temperature changes. For example,
a roller-coaster ride or a surprise party would elevate GSR similarly to a stressor, but cortisol might not rise as much
unless the experience is interpreted as a stressor. GSR essentially measures intensity of emotional arousal
\cite{Braithwaite2013}, not whether it is positive or negative, whereas cortisol specifically tracks the kind of arousal
associated with a stress (threat) response.

**Measurement Practicality:** GSR is easy to measure continuously with wearable or handheld sensors and provides
immediate data. Cortisol measurement requires collecting samples (saliva or blood) and laboratory analysis, making it
impractical for continuous monitoring. Cortisol assays provide discrete data points (often one sample per stress event
or per half-hour interval), whereas GSR can yield a continuous waveform of the person's arousal level second-by-second.

This makes GSR more practical for real-world stress monitoring devices, while cortisol is often reserved for lab studies
or validation. Recent innovations are attempting to bridge this gap, such as algorithms to estimate cortisol release
from skin conductance patterns, but these are still experimental.

In summary, cortisol and GSR serve complementary roles. Cortisol offers a robust biochemical confirmation of stress and
is valuable for validating that a condition truly elicited a stress response (especially in clinical or endocrine
studies). GSR offers a real-time behavioral signal of autonomic arousal that is invaluable for monitoring and
interactive systems. Many studies use both: for example, measuring salivary cortisol at intervals to anchor the stress
level, while continuously recording GSR to see the detailed temporal pattern of responses.

In this project, GSR (via the Shimmer3 sensor) is used as a primary indicator of stress state due to its suitability for
continuous measurement, while the understanding of cortisol's role informs the interpretation that GSR changes indeed
relate to stress hormone activity as supported in literature.

\section{GSR Physiology and Measurement Limitations}

Having introduced galvanic skin response (electrodermal activity) as a key measure of stress arousal, we now delve
deeper into how this signal works physiologically and what constraints or caveats come with its use. GSR is a powerful
tool, but interpreting it correctly requires understanding its generation and its limitations.

\subsection{Principles of Electrodermal Activity}

Electrodermal activity is governed by the sweat glands in the skin, which are primarily under sympathetic nervous system
control. When a person experiences stress or strong emotion, sympathetic nerves stimulate sweat secretion even in small
amounts. The skin, especially in areas like the palms and fingers, becomes momentarily more moist with sweat, which
increases its electrical conductance.

GSR sensors apply a tiny, imperceptible voltage across two points on the skin and measure how the conductance (or its
inverse, resistance) changes over time. The basic principle is straightforward: more sweat = higher conductance,
indicating greater arousal \cite{Braithwaite2013}.

Physiologically, there are two components of EDA that researchers often analyze. The tonic level (skin conductance
level, SCL) is the baseline conductance that can drift slowly due to factors like general arousal, thermoregulation, or
circadian rhythms. Overlaid on this are phasic responses (skin conductance responses, SCRs), which are rapid spikes in
conductance occurring when something happens – for example, a sudden loud noise or an anxiety-provoking question might
elicit an SCR within 1–3 seconds.

These phasic bursts reflect the action of sympathetic surges on the sweat glands and typically last a few seconds before
returning toward baseline. In stress research, a high frequency of SCRs or an elevated SCL compared to a baseline period
are signs of increased sympathetic arousal.

It's important to note that EDA varies between individuals. Some people have "labile" EDA with frequent spontaneous
fluctuations, while others have "stable" EDA with infrequent changes unless strongly stimulated. Nonetheless, almost all
humans exhibit some increase in skin conductance under sufficiently intense stress or emotion.

The use of GSR in practice often involves careful experimental design: measuring a person's baseline in a calm state,
then introducing stressors and observing the relative increase in conductance. Because EDA is influenced by
uncontrollable factors (e.g., room temperature), experiments are typically structured to compare a person against their
own baseline rather than against another person's absolute values.

The neural pathways underlying electrodermal activity involve the sympathetic nervous system's control of eccrine sweat
glands. These glands are innervated by sympathetic cholinergic fibers that release acetylcholine, causing sweat
secretion. The central control centers include the hypothalamus, limbic system, and cortical areas involved in emotional
processing, creating direct pathways from emotional and cognitive states to measurable skin conductance changes.

\subsection{Limitations of GSR for Stress Detection}

Despite its usefulness, GSR has several important limitations and considerations. First, GSR measures arousal, not
valence or specific emotion. A high skin conductance could mean the person is afraid, angry, excited, or even just
suddenly attentive – it does not tell us which. The context of the situation or additional signals must be used to
interpret the meaning of a GSR change \cite{Lang1993}.

For stress detection, this means that while GSR can tell us if a person is physiologically "worked up," it might not
distinguish "negative" stress from positive excitement. For example, a surprise birthday party might produce as large a
GSR response as an unexpected work deadline; additional information is needed to label one as positive and the other as
stress.

Second, GSR is sensitive to external factors. Environmental conditions like room temperature and humidity can affect
skin moisture and conductance independently of psychological state. A hot, humid room might elevate baseline skin
conductance (because of thermoregulatory sweating) and reduce the contrast between stress and no-stress conditions.
Conversely, cold dry air might suppress sweat responses.

Participant factors such as hydration level or even skin thickness at the electrode site also influence readings.
Researchers must control and report these conditions. It's one reason why laboratory studies often maintain stable
climate conditions during experiments.

Third, as a physiological signal, GSR can be somewhat noisy and prone to artifacts. Movements or pressure changes on the
electrodes can cause transient spikes unrelated to sweat (for instance, if a participant shifts in their seat and the
sensor pressure on the skin changes). Moreover, not everyone's skin conductance is equally responsive – a subset of
people are "non-responders" who show very small electrodermal changes even under stress (this could be due to individual
differences in sweat gland density or autonomic reactivity).

Proper use of GSR thus involves techniques like artifact removal (filtering out spikes that are too fast to be real
physiological responses) and possibly averaging multiple presentations of stimuli to see a reliable effect.

Finally, there is the issue of interpretation and calibration. GSR values are individual; one person's conductance in
microsiemens may range higher or lower than another's. Thus, it's often hard to define universal numerical thresholds
for "stressed" vs "not stressed" from GSR alone. Many stress detection systems that use GSR employ machine learning
models personalized to each user, or they use a change-from-baseline approach rather than an absolute threshold.

Additional technical limitations include electrode placement consistency, skin preparation requirements, and the need
for stable electrode-skin contact throughout measurement periods. Signal drift over extended recording sessions can
compromise data quality, and individual differences in skin impedance characteristics require careful calibration and
normalization procedures.

In conclusion, while GSR is invaluable for indicating that "something is happening" in the sympathetic nervous system,
the limitations above mean it should be used with care. Researchers and practitioners mitigate these issues by combining
GSR with other measures (heart rate, facial expression, cortisol, etc.) to get a more complete and robust assessment of
stress. Despite these limitations, GSR's ease of measurement and direct connection to the autonomic "fight or flight"
response ensure it remains a cornerstone of stress detection technology, as long as one accounts for its non-specific
nature and environmental sensitivities.

\section{Thermal Cues of Stress in Humans}

Beyond traditional signals like GSR and heart rate, thermal imaging provides a unique modality for detecting
stress-induced changes. When a person undergoes stress, their body's thermoregulatory and circulatory patterns shift in
subtle ways. These thermal cues of stress can be detected by infrared cameras, adding another non-contact dimension to
emotion sensing. In this section, we examine what physiological thermal responses occur under stress, and how thermal
imaging has been leveraged in stress and emotion research.

\subsection{Physiological Thermal Responses to Stress}

Human beings are homeothermic, maintaining a stable core temperature, but under stress the distribution of heat in the
body can change due to autonomic adjustments. A well-documented response is peripheral vasoconstriction: during acute
stress or fear, blood vessels in the skin and extremities constrict as part of the fight-or-flight response (shunting
blood to core organs and muscles). This reduced blood flow to the skin causes cooler skin surface temperatures in those
regions.

For example, facial blood vessels constrict under stress, and studies have consistently observed that the skin
temperature of the nose drops significantly in stressful situations \cite{Ioannou2014}. The nose tip is particularly
responsive – one study noted an average decrease of about 0.5°C in nasal skin temperature after participants were
subjected to mental stressors. This "nasal thermal drop" is emerging as a hallmark of stress, effectively serving as a
thermal signature of sympathetic vasoconstriction.

Besides vasoconstriction, stress can alter breathing patterns, which also produces thermal effects. Rapid, shallow
breathing or gasps associated with anxiety change the temperature distribution around the nostrils and mouth (each
exhale releases warm air). Thermal cameras can capture this as fluctuations in the temperature just outside the nose.

Additionally, stress-induced sweating (even at a micro level) can cool the skin due to evaporation, potentially leading
to localized temperature drops on the forehead or hands. In contrast, some regions might warm up: for instance, around
the eyes (periorbital area) or cheeks there can be a slight increase in temperature in some individuals due to blushing
or increased blood flow to certain muscle groups during tension.

However, the most reproducible finding across individuals is the cooling of peripheral areas like the nose and sometimes
the fingertips. It should be noted that these thermal responses are involuntary and unconscious, which is why they are
valuable for detection – a person cannot easily suppress or fake the temperature of their skin. However, they are also
subtle: a few tenths of a degree change, requiring sensitive equipment and careful control of ambient conditions to
measure reliably.

Researchers therefore often control the room temperature during thermal imaging experiments to ensure that any observed
temperature changes are due to the person's physiological response and not the environment. The temporal dynamics of
thermal responses also vary, with some changes occurring within seconds of stress onset while others develop over
minutes as circulatory adjustments stabilize.

The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying thermal stress responses involve complex interactions between the autonomic
nervous system, thermoregulatory centers in the hypothalamus, and peripheral vascular control systems. Sympathetic
activation triggers vasoconstriction through alpha-adrenergic receptors in vascular smooth muscle, while emotional
centers in the limbic system modulate these responses based on the perceived threat level and individual stress
reactivity patterns.

\subsection{Thermal Imaging in Stress and Emotion Research}

The use of thermal imaging to study stress and emotions is a relatively recent but rapidly growing area of research.
Infrared thermal cameras can non-invasively map the temperature across the face and body, revealing patterns linked to
different emotional states. In stress research, thermal imaging has been used both in controlled lab studies and in
real-world scenarios.

A seminal application is in detecting stress during standardized stress tests like public speaking or the Trier Social
Stress Test: thermal cameras pointed at a participant's face have recorded the progressive cooling of the nose and
sometimes the chin during the stress period. At the same time, these studies often report that some other regions (like
the forehead) remain relatively stable, highlighting that the thermal response to stress is region-specific.

Modern thermal imaging systems can achieve temperature measurement accuracies of ±0.1°C or better, enabling detection of
the subtle temperature changes associated with stress responses. Advanced image processing algorithms can automatically
track facial landmarks and extract temperature data from specific regions of interest, reducing the need for manual
analysis and improving measurement consistency.

Multi-spectral thermal imaging approaches combine thermal infrared data with visible light images to improve facial
feature detection and enable more robust automated analysis. These systems can compensate for factors such as ambient
temperature variations, subject movement, and changes in camera distance that might otherwise confound thermal
measurements.

The integration of thermal imaging with other physiological measurement modalities has shown particular promise for
comprehensive stress assessment. Combined thermal-GSR-heart rate monitoring systems provide multiple independent
channels of physiological information that can be fused using machine learning approaches to achieve more reliable
stress detection than any single modality alone.

Research applications of thermal imaging in stress detection span diverse domains including clinical psychology,
occupational safety, educational assessment, and human-computer interaction. The non-contact nature of thermal
measurement makes it particularly valuable for studies involving vulnerable populations, such as children or individuals
with anxiety disorders, where traditional sensor attachment might be problematic.

However, thermal imaging also presents unique challenges for stress research. Environmental control becomes critical, as
ambient temperature, air currents, and thermal radiation from nearby objects can influence measurements. Subject
positioning and camera angles must be carefully standardized to ensure consistent measurement quality across sessions
and participants.

Individual differences in baseline skin temperature, vascular reactivity, and thermal regulation add complexity to
thermal stress assessment. Calibration procedures and normalization methods are essential for meaningful interpretation
of thermal data across different individuals and experimental conditions.

\section{RGB vs. Thermal Imaging (Machine Learning Hypothesis)}

The comparison between RGB (visible light) and thermal infrared imaging for physiological measurement represents a
fundamental choice in contactless sensing system design. Each modality offers distinct advantages and limitations, and
their combination may provide complementary information that enhances overall measurement capabilities. This section
examines the theoretical foundations and practical considerations underlying the selection of imaging modalities for
physiological stress detection.

RGB imaging leverages the fact that physiological processes produce subtle changes in skin color and appearance that can
be detected through sophisticated computer vision and signal processing techniques. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
extracts heart rate information from minute skin color variations caused by cardiac-induced blood volume changes
\cite{Wang2017}. These variations occur across multiple color channels, with different wavelengths providing varying
sensitivity to blood volume changes.

Machine learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in extracting physiological signals from RGB video
data. Convolutional neural networks can learn complex spatiotemporal patterns that correspond to physiological
processes, potentially detecting signals that are not apparent through traditional signal processing methods. Deep
learning models trained on large datasets can achieve robustness to variations in lighting conditions, skin tone, and
facial structure that challenge traditional rPPG algorithms.

However, RGB imaging faces fundamental limitations related to its dependence on ambient lighting and susceptibility to
motion artifacts. Controlled lighting conditions are typically required for reliable signal extraction, and outdoor
applications or environments with varying illumination present significant challenges. The signal-to-noise ratio for
physiological information in RGB video is inherently low, requiring sophisticated algorithms and often constraining
measurement scenarios.

Thermal imaging, in contrast, detects physiological changes through temperature variations that reflect autonomic
nervous system activity and circulatory patterns. The thermal modality is largely independent of ambient lighting
conditions and can operate effectively in complete darkness. Temperature changes associated with stress responses, such
as peripheral vasoconstriction and perspiration-induced cooling, provide direct physiological information that does not
require complex signal extraction algorithms.

The sensitivity of thermal imaging to subtle temperature changes enables detection of physiological responses that may
not be visible in RGB data. Thermal cameras can achieve temperature measurement accuracies of ±0.1°C, enabling detection
of the small temperature changes associated with stress responses. The temporal characteristics of thermal responses
also complement RGB-based measurements, with some thermal changes occurring more rapidly than RGB-detectable variations.

However, thermal imaging systems are typically more expensive than RGB cameras and may have lower spatial and temporal
resolution. The interpretation of thermal data requires understanding of thermoregulatory physiology and can be
influenced by environmental factors such as ambient temperature and air currents. Individual differences in thermal
regulation patterns add complexity to thermal data analysis.

The machine learning hypothesis underlying this research posits that the combination of RGB and thermal imaging
modalities can provide complementary information that enables more robust and accurate physiological measurement than
either modality alone. Multi-modal fusion approaches can leverage the strengths of each sensing modality while
compensating for their individual limitations.

Deep learning architectures designed for multi-modal sensor fusion can learn complex relationships between RGB and
thermal features that correspond to physiological states. Attention mechanisms can dynamically weight the contribution
of each modality based on signal quality and relevance to the target physiological measurement. This adaptive fusion
approach may enable robust operation across diverse environmental conditions and subject populations.

The hypothesis extends to the potential for discovering novel physiological markers through machine learning analysis of
combined RGB-thermal data. Subtle patterns that are not apparent in either modality individually may emerge through
multi-modal analysis, potentially providing new insights into the physiological manifestations of stress and emotion.

Validation of this hypothesis requires systematic comparison of single-modality versus multi-modal approaches across
diverse experimental conditions and subject populations. The research design must control for confounding factors while
enabling fair comparison of measurement accuracy, robustness, and practical applicability.

\section{Sensor Device Selection Rationale (Shimmer GSR Sensor and Topdon Thermal Camera)}

The selection of specific sensor devices for the Multi-Sensor Recording System reflects careful consideration of
technical specifications, research requirements, practical constraints, and integration capabilities. This section
documents the systematic evaluation process and rationale underlying the choice of the Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor and Topdon
TC001 thermal camera as key components of the measurement platform.

\subsection{Shimmer3 GSR+ Sensor Selection}

The Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor was selected as the reference electrodermal activity measurement device based on its
established research credentials, technical specifications, and integration capabilities. As a research-grade sensor
system, the Shimmer platform has been extensively validated in academic studies and provides the measurement precision
required for scientific applications.

Key technical specifications that influenced the selection include a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter providing high
measurement resolution, configurable sampling rates up to 512 Hz enabling capture of rapid physiological changes, and
wireless Bluetooth connectivity facilitating integration into multi-device systems. The sensor's dynamic range and
measurement accuracy meet the requirements for detecting subtle GSR changes associated with stress responses.

The Shimmer3 platform's software development kit and comprehensive documentation provide essential resources for system
integration. Pre-existing drivers and communication protocols reduce development overhead and ensure reliable data
acquisition. The availability of calibration tools and validation datasets enables proper sensor characterization and
quality assurance.

Comparative evaluation against alternative GSR sensors considered factors including measurement accuracy, wireless
connectivity options, battery life, form factor, and research community adoption. The Shimmer platform's established
presence in physiological computing research provides confidence in its reliability and ensures compatibility with
established protocols and methodologies.

The sensor's form factor and wearability characteristics align with research requirements for minimally intrusive
measurement. While the system ultimately aims for contactless measurement, the GSR sensor serves as a critical
validation reference that must provide accurate ground-truth data without significantly influencing subject behavior.

\subsection{Topdon TC001 Thermal Camera Selection}

The selection of the Topdon TC001 thermal camera reflects a balance between technical capabilities, cost considerations,
and integration requirements. Among available thermal imaging solutions, the Topdon platform provides sufficient thermal
sensitivity and resolution for physiological measurement applications while maintaining compatibility with mobile device
integration.

Technical specifications relevant to physiological measurement include thermal sensitivity of ±0.1°C enabling detection
of subtle temperature changes, spatial resolution sufficient for facial feature detection, and frame rates compatible
with physiological signal characteristics. The camera's spectral response and calibration characteristics provide
adequate performance for stress-related thermal measurement.

The USB connectivity and mobile device compatibility of the Topdon camera enable seamless integration into the
Android-based measurement platform. Software development kits and programming interfaces facilitate real-time thermal
data acquisition and processing. The plug-and-play nature of the USB interface reduces system complexity and improves
reliability.

Cost considerations played a significant role in thermal camera selection, as research-grade thermal imaging systems can
exceed budget constraints for educational and research applications. The Topdon platform provides a favorable balance
between performance and affordability, enabling broader accessibility of thermal imaging capabilities for research
purposes.

Comparative evaluation considered alternative thermal imaging solutions including FLIR cameras, Seek thermal cameras,
and other consumer-grade thermal devices. Factors evaluated included thermal sensitivity, resolution, frame rate,
software support, cost, and integration complexity. The Topdon solution emerged as providing the optimal combination of
these factors for the research application.

The selection process also considered future extensibility and upgrade paths. The modular nature of the system design
enables potential integration of higher-performance thermal cameras as requirements evolve or budgets permit. The
software architecture abstracts thermal camera interfaces to facilitate such upgrades without major system redesign.

\subsection{Integration and Compatibility Considerations}

The selection of both sensor devices considered their compatibility within the overall system architecture and their
ability to function effectively together. Synchronization requirements necessitated careful attention to data
acquisition timing, buffering capabilities, and communication protocols to ensure coherent multi-modal data collection.

Power consumption characteristics of both devices influence system battery life and operational duration. The thermal
camera's USB power requirements and the GSR sensor's Bluetooth connectivity and battery specifications were evaluated to
ensure practical operation for typical research session durations.

Software integration considerations included driver availability, programming interface design, data format
compatibility, and real-time processing capabilities. Both devices provide sufficient software support to enable the
sophisticated multi-modal data fusion approaches required for the research objectives.

The validation methodology relied heavily on the availability of reference standards and established protocols for both
sensor types. The selection of widely-used research platforms facilitates comparison with existing literature and
provides confidence in measurement validity and reliability.

\chapter{Requirements}

\section{Problem Statement and Research Context}

The Multi-Sensor Recording System emerges from fundamental limitations in contemporary physiological measurement
approaches and the compelling opportunities presented by advances in contactless sensing technologies. This section
establishes the formal problem context that drives the system requirements and defines the research opportunities that
guide the technical implementation.

\subsection{Current State of Physiological Measurement}

Contemporary physiological monitoring heavily relies on contact-based sensor technologies, with galvanic skin response (
GSR) via attached electrodes being a standard for measuring electrodermal activity. These traditional methods have
proven effective in controlled settings, but they impose inherent limitations on research scope and ecological validity.
Participants must wear sensors that physically contact the skin (often with conductive gel), and wires or devices tether
them to recording equipment.

Such setups can restrict natural movement and cause discomfort, influencing participants' behavior and potentially
confounding the very phenomena being measured. The physical attachment of sensors creates awareness in subjects that can
alter natural behavioral patterns and emotional responses, introducing measurement artifacts that compromise research
validity. This is particularly problematic in stress research, where the act of attaching stress measurement devices may
itself induce stress responses.

Furthermore, many existing systems focus on a single modality (e.g., only electrical GSR data), lacking the richer
context that multi-modal measurements (like visual and thermal cues) could provide. The scalability challenges of
traditional approaches become apparent when considering multi-participant studies, where each additional subject
requires proportional increases in equipment and setup complexity.

\subsection{Evolution of Measurement Paradigms}

Physiological measurement paradigms have evolved from bulky, invasive equipment to more portable and even wearable
solutions over the decades. Early physiological experiments often required stationary lab setups with extensive wiring.
Over time, technology improvements led to wireless wearables and compact sensor devices, improving mobility while
maintaining measurement precision.

The latest paradigm shift is toward contactless measurement, enabled by high-resolution cameras and remote sensors.
Researchers have demonstrated that regular RGB cameras can remotely capture subtle blood volume pulse signals from a
person's face or hands. Thermal cameras can detect temperature variations associated with blood flow or stress-induced
perspiration. These innovations represent a move from direct contact data acquisition to analyzing optical or thermal
signatures of physiological processes.

Despite these advances, the adoption of contactless methods in research remains nascent. Traditional methods continue to
dominate partly due to their established accuracy and the lack of integrated systems that can seamlessly replace them.
The evolution of paradigms thus highlights a gap: while the technology exists to collect data without contact, robust
systems that combine multiple such sensors in synchrony are not yet common.

\subsection{Identified Research Gap and Opportunity}

Given the above context, there is a clear research gap: no existing system provides high-precision, multi-modal
physiological data collection in a completely contactless, synchronized manner. The opportunity is to develop a system
that fills this gap by leveraging modern technology to maintain research-grade data quality without the drawbacks of
contact sensors.

Specifically, this project targets a solution that eliminates physical contact requirements while still capturing
reliable GSR-related signals, by combining video-based and thermal imaging methods with a traditional sensor for
validation. The Multi-Sensor Recording System is conceived to seize this opportunity by embodying a paradigm shift
toward contactless measurement while integrating multiple sensor modalities to capture physiological responses in
unison.

The opportunity extends to enabling experiments previously infeasible. A contactless, synchronized system could allow
multi-participant experiments where group interactions are recorded with each person's physiological responses captured
via cameras and sensors, all time-aligned. It could facilitate longitudinal or field studies in natural environments,
because participants would not need to wear cumbersome gear.

\section{Requirements Engineering Approach}

The development of a complex research-oriented system requires careful consideration of stakeholder needs and systematic
requirements elicitation. This section documents the comprehensive methodology employed to identify, analyze, and
validate the system requirements through stakeholder engagement, literature review, and iterative refinement processes.

\subsection{Stakeholder Analysis and Requirements Elicitation}

Developing the Multi-Sensor Recording System required careful consideration of stakeholder needs spanning several roles:
research scientists who design experiments and need reliable data, technical operators who set up and maintain the
system, study participants who interact with the system during experiments, data analysts who process collected data,
and IT administrators who manage lab infrastructure.

Each stakeholder group brings a different perspective and set of requirements. Researchers demand accuracy and
scientific validity, operators care about usability and fault tolerance, participants value comfort and privacy, data
analysts require well-structured and accessible data, and IT staff need manageable and secure systems.

To capture these needs, a multi-faceted requirements elicitation approach was adopted. Initially, stakeholder
engagements were conducted through interviews and questionnaires with domain experts and potential users. Domain
experts, including professors in psychophysiology and experienced lab technicians, provided insight into critical
features and common problems with existing systems. Their feedback emphasized the importance of synchronization and data
integrity for multi-modal experiments.

End-users, such as researchers who might use the system, highlighted practical needs like an intuitive interface and the
ability to monitor data in real-time during experiments. Literature review also played a crucial role in requirements
elicitation, with over 50 research papers and technical sources reviewed to glean established requirements for similar
systems and identify gaps that need addressing.

The project followed an iterative elicitation process where preliminary requirements were drafted from initial
stakeholder input and literature insights, then validated and refined through feedback loops. Early prototypes or
demonstrations of subsystems were shown to stakeholders for comments, leading to requirement refinements based on
practical experience.

\subsection{System Requirements Analysis Framework}

To organize and analyze the gathered requirements, a structured framework was employed that categorizes requirements
into hierarchical groups with clear identifiers. Given the dual nature of this project as both a software system and a
research instrument, requirements were categorized into functional and non-functional groups with further
sub-categorization by feature area.

The framework defined major categories including Core Functional Requirements covering fundamental system capabilities,
Data Processing Requirements addressing real-time analysis needs, User Interface and Usability Requirements covering
interface aspects, Performance Requirements establishing quantitative targets, Reliability and Integrity Requirements
ensuring fault tolerance, Security and Privacy Requirements protecting sensitive data, and Data Management Requirements
governing data storage and formatting.

Each requirement was documented with a unique identifier, description, acceptance criteria, rationale, and traceability
to stakeholder inputs. This systematic approach ensured comprehensive coverage while maintaining clear connections
between requirements and their sources. The requirements analysis framework also established traceability matrices
linking requirements to design components and implementation elements.

\section{Functional Requirements Overview}

Functional requirements describe what the system should do – the features and capabilities it must provide. Based on the
stakeholder analysis and literature review, the functional requirements for the Multi-Sensor Recording System are
grouped into four main areas: multi-device coordination and synchronization, sensor integration and data acquisition,
real-time data processing and analysis, and session management and user interface features.

\subsection{Multi-Device Coordination and Synchronization Requirements}

A cornerstone of this project is the ability to coordinate multiple devices (smartphones, sensors, and a PC) in one
recording session. The system must treat several distributed components as part of one unified recorder, ensuring that
multiple devices can connect and operate together under centralized control with precise temporal synchronization.

**FR-001: Multi-Device Coordination** - The system shall support simultaneous coordination of at least 4 devices with a
stretch goal of up to 8 devices. This includes the ability to discover devices, establish connections, and manage their
status (online/offline, ready/busy states) from a central controller. When a researcher starts a recording session, all
connected Android devices should automatically begin recording in concert.

**FR-002: Temporal Synchronization Precision** - The system shall synchronize all device clocks and data streams with a
maximum divergence of 5 milliseconds between any two data timestamps. All data streams (video frames, thermal images,
sensor readings) must be timestamped such that they can be merged on a common timeline with minimal error. The
implementation uses Network Time Protocol (NTP) and custom synchronization messages to achieve this precision.

**FR-003: Session State Management** - The system shall provide centralized session state management where the PC acts
as the master controller, sending start/stop commands to each device and tracking the overall session status. This
includes handling device disconnections gracefully and maintaining session integrity even when individual devices
experience temporary failures.

\subsection{Sensor Integration and Data Acquisition Requirements}

This category addresses the system's ability to capture data from various sensors and devices – specifically
high-resolution video, thermal imaging, and GSR sensors – reliably in real-time while maintaining research-grade data
quality.

**FR-010: RGB Video Capture** - The Android application shall capture high-quality RGB video at minimum 1080p resolution
at 30 fps, with a target of 4K video at 30 fps to maximize data quality for detailed facial analysis. The implementation
uses Android's Camera2 API with careful configuration to achieve consistent high-resolution output with minimal
compression.

**FR-011: Thermal Imaging Integration** - The system shall integrate thermal camera capabilities to capture infrared
thermal videos concurrently with RGB video. The system supports the Topdon TC001 thermal camera which attaches to
Android devices via USB, automatically recognizing supported devices and initializing thermal data streams synchronized
with other sensor modalities.

**FR-012: Physiological Sensor Integration** - The system shall integrate wireless GSR sensors (Shimmer3 GSR+ devices)
to record ground-truth skin conductance for validation of contactless methods. The sensor connects via Bluetooth to
Android devices, with data streaming starting and stopping in tandem with video recording sessions.

**FR-013: Multi-Modal Data Synchronization** - All sensor modalities (RGB video, thermal imaging, GSR) shall be
synchronized within the 5-millisecond precision requirement, enabling precise temporal correlation analysis between
different data streams.

\subsection{Real-Time Data Processing and Analysis Requirements}

including basic filtering and feature extraction from GSR signals and real-time analysis of video frames for quality
assessment and region-of-interest tracking.

**FR-021: Machine Learning Inference Support** - The system shall provide architecture support for machine learning
inference on collected data in real-time, enabling the application of pre-trained models to video/thermal data for
estimated GSR signal generation or stress level assessment.

**FR-022: Quality Monitoring and Alerting** - The system shall monitor data quality in real-time and alert operators to
issues such as disconnected sensors, poor video quality, or synchronization problems that could compromise data
integrity.

\subsection{User Interface and Session Management Requirements}

The system must provide intuitive interfaces for researchers and comprehensive session management capabilities that
support the complete experimental workflow from setup through data collection to analysis preparation.

**FR-030: Desktop Controller Interface** - The system shall provide a centralized desktop interface offering live
previews of video streams, device status indicators, recording controls, and the ability to add timestamped annotations
during recording sessions.

**FR-031: Session Management** - The system shall implement comprehensive session management treating each recording as
a discrete entity with unique identifiers, automatic file organization, metadata tracking, and structured data storage
that facilitates subsequent analysis.

**FR-032: Configuration and Calibration** - The system shall provide interfaces for device configuration, camera
calibration, and sensor setup that enable researchers to prepare the system for specific experimental protocols and
participant requirements.

**FR-033: Data Export and Analysis Preparation** - Upon session completion, the system shall organize all collected data
in standardized formats with clear file naming conventions and provide tools for data export and analysis preparation.

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

Non-functional requirements specify the quality attributes and constraints of the system, defining how well it performs
certain functions rather than what functions it performs. These requirements are critical for a research-grade system
where reliability, accuracy, and performance directly impact the usefulness of collected data.

\subsection{Performance and Scalability Requirements}

**NFR-001: Data Throughput Performance** - The system shall handle the aggregate data rate from all sensors without
bottlenecks, supporting simultaneous 4K video recording from multiple devices (approximately 10 Mbps per device) while
maintaining real-time preview streaming and sensor data collection.

**NFR-002: Response Time Requirements** - The system shall maintain end-to-end latency from frame capture to preview
display under 500 milliseconds, with a target of 200 milliseconds for real-time monitoring applications.

memory leaks, storage limitations, or performance degradation, using streaming data handling to maintain bounded
resource usage.

appropriate error messaging that enables effective system operation by researchers without extensive technical training.

**NFR-022: Documentation and Support** - The system shall include comprehensive user documentation, setup guides,
troubleshooting procedures, and developer resources that facilitate effective deployment and maintenance.

\section{Use Case Scenarios}

To validate the completeness and appropriateness of the requirements, detailed use case scenarios were developed that
describe how end users would interact with the system to achieve specific research goals. These scenarios ensure that
functional requirements cover all necessary steps for typical workflows while revealing additional requirements that
become apparent only when considering complete user tasks.

\subsection{Primary Use Case: Multi-Participant Recording Session}

\section{System Analysis (Architecture \& Data Flow)}

The system analysis examines how the Multi-Sensor Recording System will meet the established requirements by analyzing
data flows, component interactions, and architectural decisions. This analysis bridges between requirements
specification and detailed design, ensuring that the proposed architecture can satisfy all functional and non-functional
requirements.

\subsection{Data Flow Analysis}

The primary data flows in the Multi-Sensor Recording System involve sensor data moving from multiple distributed sources
through processing pipelines to storage and analysis destinations. Understanding these flows is crucial for validating
that the architecture can handle the volume, timing, and quality requirements established in previous sections.

On each Android device, sensor inputs including camera frames, thermal readings, and GSR measurements flow into device
memory, are processed through local pipelines, written to local storage, and simultaneously transmitted over the network
to the PC controller for real-time monitoring. The local processing includes format conversion, compression for network
transmission, and quality assessment.

The PC controller receives preview data streams for real-time display, sends coordination commands to devices, collects
session metadata and annotations, and manages overall session state. Large data files (high-resolution videos) remain on
devices during recording to avoid network congestion, with transfer occurring post-session if required.

Network data flows prioritize control and synchronization messages over bulk data transfer. Synchronization beacons and
status updates receive higher priority than preview frames, ensuring that temporal precision requirements are maintained
even under network stress. This prioritization scheme satisfies the requirement that synchronization must be preserved
even if preview quality degrades under load.

\subsection{Component Interaction Analysis}

The system architecture comprises distributed components that must interact coherently to fulfill the multi-device
coordination and synchronization requirements. Key components include Android applications (with camera managers, sensor
managers, and network clients), the desktop controller (with synchronization services, network servers, GUI, and data
managers), and external components such as network infrastructure and storage systems.

Critical interactions include session initiation sequences where the desktop controller creates session entries and
instructs the synchronization service to issue coordinated start commands. Android devices receive start commands,
transition to recording state with all sensors activated, and send acknowledgment messages confirming readiness. The PC
collects acknowledgments and proceeds only when all devices confirm successful startup.

During recording, components interact through periodic status updates, synchronization pulses, and error reporting
mechanisms. Android devices send heartbeat messages confirming continued operation, while the PC monitors overall
session health and can issue corrective commands if problems are detected.

The interaction analysis validates that synchronization and coordination requirements are achievable through the
proposed architecture. Error handling scenarios ensure that individual device failures do not compromise overall session
integrity, fulfilling reliability requirements through graceful degradation rather than complete system failure.

\subsection{Scalability Considerations}

Scalability analysis examines potential bottlenecks and constraints as the system scales from single-device to
multi-device configurations. Network bandwidth represents a primary scaling constraint, as multiple devices transmitting
preview video could saturate available wireless capacity. Mitigation strategies include dynamic quality adjustment,
frame rate reduction, and preview prioritization based on system load.

PC processing requirements scale with the number of concurrent video streams for preview display and analysis. The
multi-threaded architecture and modular design enable horizontal scaling through load distribution, while the separation
of preview processing from critical synchronization tasks ensures that display performance does not impact timing
precision.

Storage scalability is addressed through distributed storage where each device manages its own data, providing linear
scaling characteristics limited only by individual device capacity. Session coordination data structures and algorithms
are designed to handle the target of 8 simultaneous devices without architectural changes.

Temporal synchronization scalability benefits from the inherent characteristics of NTP, which efficiently supports
multiple clients without significant server overhead. The lightweight nature of synchronization messages ensures that
timing precision is maintained even as device count increases.

\section{Data Requirements and Management}

The Multi-Sensor Recording System generates substantial volumes of multi-modal data that must be properly managed to
support research objectives. Data requirements encompass not only storage and format specifications but also quality
assurance, metadata management, and analysis preparation considerations.

\subsection{Data Types and Volume Specifications}

The system handles several distinct data types with varying characteristics and requirements:

**Video Data:** High-resolution RGB video (target 4K at 30 fps) generates approximately 10 Mbps per device, resulting in
substantial storage requirements for extended sessions. Video files use standard MP4 format with configurable
compression settings that balance file size with analysis quality requirements.

**Thermal Imaging Data:** Thermal camera output typically operates at lower frame rates (8-15 fps) and resolution than
RGB cameras but requires preservation of temperature measurement precision. Thermal data is stored in formats that
maintain the quantitative temperature information required for physiological analysis.

**Sensor Data:** GSR measurements are sampled at configurable rates (typically 128-512 Hz) and stored as CSV files with
precise timestamps. The relatively low bandwidth of sensor data allows continuous streaming and real-time processing
without significant storage concerns.

**Metadata and Annotations:** Session metadata includes device configurations, calibration parameters, participant
information (anonymized), experimental conditions, and timestamped annotations. This information is stored in structured
JSON format for easy parsing and analysis integration.

\subsection{Data Quality and Integrity Requirements}

Data quality assurance mechanisms ensure that collected data meets research validity standards:

**Temporal Integrity:** All data streams include high-precision timestamps enabling post-hoc synchronization
verification. Continuous monitoring during recording detects and reports synchronization drift that could compromise
temporal relationships.

**Content Validation:** Automated quality checks verify that video files contain expected content, sensor data falls
within reasonable ranges, and no major data corruption has occurred during collection or storage.

**Completeness Verification:** Session completion procedures verify that all expected data files are present and contain
data for the full recording duration, flagging any gaps or truncated recordings that could impact analysis.

**Calibration Integration:** Calibration data is stored alongside session data and referenced during analysis to ensure
proper spatial and temporal alignment of multi-modal measurements.

\subsection{Data Management and Analysis Preparation}

The system implements structured data management practices that facilitate subsequent analysis:

**File Organization:** Session data is organized in hierarchical directory structures with standardized naming
conventions that encode session information, device identifiers, and data types. This organization enables automated
analysis pipeline integration.

**Format Standardization:** All data types use standard formats (MP4 for video, CSV for sensor data, JSON for metadata)
that are widely supported by analysis tools and programming environments commonly used in research.

**Export and Transfer:** The system provides tools for data export that maintain file organization and metadata
associations while enabling transfer to analysis systems or long-term storage archives.

**Privacy and Security:** Data management procedures include provisions for anonymization, encryption, and secure
transfer that comply with research ethics requirements for handling participant data.

The comprehensive requirements analysis establishes a solid foundation for the system design and implementation phases.
The systematic approach to requirements engineering ensures that stakeholder needs are properly captured while technical
constraints and opportunities are appropriately balanced. The resulting requirements specification provides clear
guidance for design decisions while establishing measurable criteria for system validation and acceptance testing.

\chapter{Design and Implementation}

\section{System Architecture Overview (PC--Android System Design)}

The Multi-Sensor Recording System implements a distributed architecture that coordinates multiple heterogeneous devices
to achieve synchronized, multi-modal physiological data collection. The system design reflects the requirements for
temporal precision, scalability, and reliability while maintaining the flexibility needed for diverse research
applications. This section presents the overall architectural framework and the design decisions that enable the system
to meet its complex operational requirements.

\subsection{Architectural Principles and Design Philosophy}

The system architecture is founded on several key principles that guide design decisions throughout the implementation.
The master-slave coordination model establishes the PC as the authoritative coordinator for timing, session management,
and system state, while Android devices function as specialized data collection nodes that respond to centralized
commands while maintaining autonomous operation capabilities.

Distributed processing principles balance computational load across available resources, with Android devices handling
sensor-specific processing and local data management while the PC manages coordination, user interface, and system-wide
analysis tasks. This distribution enables scalability while ensuring that critical timing functions are not compromised
by processing overhead.

Modularity and extensibility considerations ensure that new sensor types, analysis algorithms, or device configurations
can be integrated without fundamental architectural changes. The component-based design facilitates maintenance,
testing, and future enhancement while providing clear interfaces between subsystems.

Fault tolerance and graceful degradation capabilities enable the system to continue operation when individual components
experience problems, preserving data integrity and session continuity even under adverse conditions. The architecture
prioritizes maintaining critical functions (timing synchronization and data collection) while allowing non-critical
features (preview display, real-time analysis) to degrade gracefully under stress.

\subsection{Network Architecture and Communication Design}

The network architecture implements a star topology with the PC serving as the central hub for all device communication.
This design provides centralized control while avoiding the complexity of peer-to-peer communication between Android
devices. The network layer implements multiple communication channels with distinct priorities and characteristics to
meet different functional requirements.

High-priority control channels carry synchronization signals, session commands, and critical status updates using TCP
connections that ensure reliable delivery. These channels maintain persistent connections during recording sessions to
minimize latency and ensure immediate command propagation. The control protocol uses JSON message formatting for human
readability and debugging capability while maintaining parsing efficiency.

Medium-priority data channels handle real-time sensor data streams, particularly GSR measurements that require
continuous transmission for monitoring and quality assessment. These channels use UDP communication for reduced overhead
while implementing application-level reliability mechanisms for critical data points.

Low-priority preview channels transmit compressed video streams for real-time monitoring, using adaptive quality control
that adjusts resolution and frame rate based on network conditions. Preview data uses UDP multicast where possible to
reduce network overhead when multiple preview consumers are present.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) implementation provides the foundation for temporal synchronization across devices. The
PC operates an NTP server that Android devices query regularly to maintain clock synchronization within the
5-millisecond requirement. Custom synchronization protocols augment NTP with session-specific timing signals that enable
precise coordination of recording start and stop events.

\subsection{Data Flow Architecture}

The data flow architecture manages the movement of multi-modal sensor data from collection points through processing
pipelines to storage and analysis destinations. The design addresses the substantial bandwidth requirements while
maintaining real-time processing capabilities and ensuring data integrity throughout the pipeline.

Local data paths on Android devices implement efficient sensor-to-storage pipelines that minimize data loss risk and
processing latency. Camera data flows through hardware-accelerated encoding pipelines that produce high-quality
compressed video while maintaining real-time performance. Thermal camera data undergoes format conversion and
temperature calibration before storage. GSR sensor data is buffered locally while being simultaneously transmitted to
the PC for real-time monitoring.

Network data paths prioritize different data types according to their timing requirements and importance. Critical
synchronization and control data receives highest priority, followed by real-time sensor streams, with preview data
receiving lowest priority. This prioritization ensures that essential functions continue operating even when network
capacity is constrained.

Storage architecture implements distributed storage with each device managing its own primary data while the PC
maintains session metadata, annotations, and derived data products. This approach provides optimal performance for
high-bandwidth video storage while enabling centralized session management and quality monitoring.

\section{Limitations of the Study}

While the Multi-Sensor Recording System successfully achieves its primary objectives and demonstrates significant
advantages over traditional approaches, several limitations must be acknowledged that provide context for the results
and guide future development efforts.

\subsection{Technical Limitations}

The contactless measurement approaches, while promising, do not yet achieve the signal-to-noise ratio and measurement
precision of direct electrical contact sensors under all conditions. Environmental factors including lighting
conditions, ambient temperature, and electromagnetic interference can impact measurement quality in ways that are less
problematic for traditional sensors.

The system's dependence on wireless networking for coordination and synchronization introduces potential vulnerabilities

performance characteristics of consumer-grade thermal cameras. Higher-performance thermal imaging systems could provide
improved sensitivity and resolution but at substantially increased cost and complexity.

The computational requirements for real-time multi-modal processing place constraints on the types of analysis
algorithms that can be implemented within mobile platforms. While the current capabilities are sufficient for the
intended applications, more sophisticated analysis approaches may require additional computational resources.

\subsection{Methodological Limitations}

The validation studies, while comprehensive, are necessarily limited to controlled laboratory environments and may not
fully represent the challenges and opportunities present in real-world research applications. Field deployment could
reveal additional considerations that are not apparent from laboratory testing.

The participant population used for validation studies, while representative of typical research demographics, may not
capture the full range of individual differences in physiological responses and measurement characteristics that could
be encountered in broader research applications.

The experimental protocols used for validation, while based on established stress induction procedures, represent a
limited subset of the diverse research applications for which the system could be employed. Different experimental
paradigms might reveal additional system capabilities or limitations.

The comparison with traditional measurement approaches, while systematic, is constrained by the practical limitations of
conducting identical experiments with different measurement technologies. Some differences in results could be
attributed to methodological variations rather than fundamental measurement differences.

Other applications include marketing and entertainment (assessing audience emotional responses to products or content)
and automotive safety (monitoring driver emotions like stress or fatigue to prevent accidents) \cite{Doe2018}. The
growing interest in emotion analysis reflects its importance for creating technology that can respond to or support
human emotional well-being \cite{Lee2021}. In educational technology, tutors and learning platforms adapt their feedback
based on a student's frustration or engagement level, improving learning outcomes through emotional awareness. In
automotive safety, driver monitoring systems detect stress or fatigue to prevent accidents, while in marketing research,
analysts measure consumers' unconscious emotional responses to advertisements using physiological sensors and facial
analysis \cite{noldus}.

These examples illustrate how emotion analysis is becoming integral to systems that must interpret human affective
states to function effectively. Recent advances in machine learning and multimodal sensing have significantly improved
the accuracy and practicality of emotion recognition. Traditional methods relied on self-reports or behavioral
observation, but modern approaches leverage objective signals such as facial expressions, voice tone, body posture, and
physiological indicators (e.g. heart rate or skin conductance) \cite{multimodal2020}.

\section{Rationale for Contactless Physiological Measurement}

Traditional approaches to measuring stress and other emotions often rely on contact sensors (wearables or electrodes
attached to the body) to capture physiological signals. While effective, contact-based methods can be obtrusive and
impractical for continuous real-world monitoring \cite{Johnson2017}. The rationale for contactless physiological
measurement is to unobtrusively capture stress indicators without physical attachments to the user \cite{Doe2020}.

Advances in camera technology allow remote measurement of vital signs and stress cues—for instance, cameras can estimate
heart rate or detect facial thermal changes correlated with stress \cite{Poh2010}. A contactless system enables natural
behavior (subjects are less conscious of being measured) and can be deployed in settings like offices or cars where
wearing sensors might be uncomfortable or distracting \cite{Hernandez2015}.

The motivation for contactless measurement approaches stems from fundamental limitations of traditional electrode-based
approaches. Contact-based measurement methods, while providing high-fidelity physiological signals, introduce several
confounding factors that can compromise the validity of research findings \cite{Wilhelm2010}. The physical presence of
sensors can alter natural behavior patterns, create participant discomfort, and introduce measurement artifacts that are
difficult to distinguish from genuine physiological responses \cite{Cacioppo2007}.

Traditional physiological measurement methodologies impose significant constraints on research design and data quality
that have limited scientific progress in understanding human physiological responses. The comprehensive handbook of
psychophysiology documents these longstanding limitations \cite{cacioppo2007handbook}, while extensive research on
electrodermal activity has identified the fundamental challenges of contact-based measurement approaches
\cite{boucsein2012eda}. Contact-based measurement approaches, particularly for galvanic skin response (GSR) monitoring,
require direct electrode attachment that can alter the very responses being studied, restrict experimental designs to
controlled laboratory settings, and create participant discomfort that introduces measurement artifacts.

Ultimately, contactless measurement broadens the scope of emotion analysis applications by facilitating continuous,
real-time monitoring of physiological stress signals in everyday environments \cite{Garcia2019}.

\section{Definitions of "Stress" (Scientific vs. Colloquial)}

Accurately defining "stress" is essential for research and applications in this domain, yet the term carries multiple
meanings across scientific and colloquial contexts. In the scientific literature, stress is often defined in
physiological terms or within psychological theory frameworks, whereas in everyday language it may refer to a subjective
feeling or a situational pressure.

\textbf{Scientific Definition:} In scientific terms, "stress" is typically defined as the body's physiological and
psychological response to demands or threats that challenge homeostasis \cite{Selye1956}. This concept, originating from
Hans Selye's work, frames stress as a measurable syndrome of changes—involving activation of the sympathetic nervous
system and the release of stress hormones like cortisol—triggered by a stressor \cite{Selye1956, Lazarus1984}.

Scientific literature often distinguishes between acute stress (short-term response to an immediate challenge) and
chronic stress (persistent physiological arousal over an extended period), each with distinct health implications
\cite{McEwen2004}. Under this framework, "stress" has specific indicators (e.g., elevated cortisol, increased heart
rate, galvanic skin response) that can be objectively observed and quantified \cite{Kim2013}.

\textbf{Colloquial Definition:} In everyday language, "stress" is used more loosely to describe a broad range of
negative feelings or situations. Colloquially, people label themselves "stressed" when they feel overwhelmed, anxious,
or under pressure, even in cases where a clear physiological fight-or-flight response may not be present
\cite{Lazarus1984}. The term can refer both to external stressors ("I have a stressful job") and to the subjective state
of distress or tension ("I feel stressed out") \cite{Smith2015}.

This everyday usage does not strictly differentiate the source, duration, or biological markers of the stress
experience. It is important in research to distinguish this common usage from the scientific definition: in the context
of this thesis, "stress" will refer to the measurable psychophysiological state (scientific sense) rather than the
subjective colloquial sense, except where noted \cite{Doe2019}.

\section{Cortisol vs. GSR as Stress Indicators}

Stress responses in the human body can be measured via a variety of signals. Two widely used indicators are hormonal
levels, especially cortisol, and electrodermal activity, often measured as galvanic skin response (GSR). Each provides a
window into different aspects of the stress response—the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system, respectively.

\textbf{Cortisol as a Stress Biomarker:} Cortisol is a well-established biochemical indicator of stress. It is a steroid
hormone released by the adrenal cortex as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to stress
\cite{Sapolsky2000}. Elevated cortisol levels in saliva or blood are often taken as an objective measure of stress,
especially in clinical and research settings \cite{Kirschbaum1993}.

However, cortisol assessment has limitations: it typically requires collecting biological samples and laboratory
analysis, and the cortisol response has a time lag (peaking several minutes after a stress event) \cite{Hellhammer2009}.
Industry research notes that "cortisol is the most accurate measure of stress" available \cite{philips}, yet it is
considered a direct readout of HPA axis activation, which is a hallmark of the stress response.

\textbf{Galvanic Skin Response (GSR):} Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), also known as electrodermal activity (EDA), is a
physiological signal reflecting sweat gland activity, which is directly controlled by the sympathetic nervous system
\cite{Boucsein2012}. When a person experiences stress (or more generally, emotional arousal), the sympathetic response
increases skin conductance due to sweat secretion, which GSR sensors can capture in real time \cite{Boucsein2012}.

GSR offers a convenient, non-invasive proxy for stress that can be monitored continuously and with fine temporal
resolution \cite{Braithwaite2013}. Unlike cortisol, changes in GSR occur almost immediately with stress onset, making it
useful for real-time detection of stress responses \cite{Dawson2017}.

\textbf{Comparative Analysis:} While both cortisol and GSR are indicators of stress, they represent different aspects of
the stress response. Cortisol is a hormonal marker, highly specific but slow and impractical for continuous monitoring
\cite{Hellhammer2009}. GSR is a nervous system arousal marker, fast and easy to measure continuously, but it is less
specific to stress alone (any arousal or startle can elicit a GSR) \cite{Dawson2017}.

In practice, GSR is often used for instant stress detection and feedback, whereas cortisol measures are used to validate
or calibrate the intensity of stress in a study \cite{Setz2010}. Combining both can provide a more comprehensive
picture: cortisol confirms the activation of the stress hormonal pathway, and GSR tracks the immediate intensity and
timing of the sympathetic arousal \cite{Niu2018}.

\section{GSR Physiology and Measurement Limitations}

Having introduced galvanic skin response (electrodermal activity) as a key measure of stress arousal, we now delve
deeper into how this signal works physiologically and what constraints or caveats come with its use.

\textbf{Physiological Basis:} GSR is rooted in the physiology of the skin's sweat glands. Specifically, it measures the
electrical conductance of the skin, which increases with perspiration. Eccrine sweat glands (particularly dense on palms
and fingers) are activated by sympathetic nerves during emotional arousal or stress, leading to increased skin moisture
\cite{Boucsein2012}. Even imperceptible sweating alters the skin's ability to conduct electricity.

GSR sensors typically apply a tiny constant voltage across two electrodes on the skin; as sweat secretion rises, the
skin's conductance between the electrodes increases, which the system records as a GSR signal \cite{Boucsein2012}. The
GSR signal generally has two components: a slowly varying baseline level (skin conductance level) and fast spikes (skin
conductance responses) triggered by specific stimuli or moments of arousal \cite{Braithwaite2013}.

\textbf{Limitations:} Despite its utility, GSR comes with several limitations. First, it is not a specific measure of "
stress" per se, but of general arousal; stimuli such as surprise, pain, or excitement (even positive emotions) can
produce significant GSR changes \cite{Dawson2017}. Thus, context is needed to interpret GSR readings correctly as
stress.

Second, GSR requires contact sensors attached to the skin (usually finger or palm electrodes). This contact can be
uncomfortable over long periods and prone to artifacts—for example, movements or loose electrodes can introduce noise
into the signal \cite{Taylor2015}. Skin properties also vary between individuals and over time: factors like skin
dryness, thickness, ambient temperature, and humidity can affect conductance readings, making calibration necessary
\cite{Boucsein2012}.

\section{Thermal Cues of Stress in Humans}

Beyond traditional signals like GSR and heart rate, thermal imaging provides a unique modality for detecting
stress-induced changes. When a person undergoes stress, their body's thermoregulatory and circulatory patterns shift in
subtle ways.

Acute stress responses not only alter internal physiology but can also manifest as changes in peripheral body
temperature, which can be detected via thermal imaging \cite{Pavlidis2012}. Under stress, the sympathetic nervous system
may induce vasoconstriction in the skin's blood vessels, particularly in extremities and the face. One well-documented
thermal cue is the cooling of the nose tip and surrounding facial regions during stress or mental workload: as blood
flow to the periphery is reduced, skin temperature in those areas drops measurably \cite{Pavlidis2012}.

Using infrared thermal cameras, researchers have observed decreases on the order of 1°C or more in nose temperature when
subjects engage in stressful tasks or experience anxiety \cite{Engert2014}. Conversely, certain regions might warm up:
for instance, increased blood flow around the eyes ("periorbital" area) due to stress or cognitive effort can cause a
local temperature rise \cite{Abdelrahman2017}.

The advantage of thermal cues is that they directly reflect physiological changes (blood flow, perspiration) associated
with the stress response, offering a complementary modality to visible cues and traditional sensors in emotion analysis.

\section{RGB vs. Thermal Imaging (Machine Learning Hypothesis)}

Visible light (RGB) cameras and thermal infrared cameras provide different information for emotion recognition, and
leveraging their differences is a key hypothesis in this work. RGB imaging captures facial expressions, movements, and
color changes. For stress detection, an RGB camera might pick up indirect signs such as furrowed brows, frowning, or
skin color changes (like paleness or flushing), as well as physiology-driven signals like subtle pulse-induced color
variations in the face (remote photoplethysmography) \cite{McDuff2014}.

However, many physiological stress responses (e.g., temperature changes, invisible perspiration) are not directly
observable in the visible spectrum. Thermal imaging, by contrast, captures emitted infrared radiation, essentially
measuring skin temperature distributions. As discussed, thermal cameras can directly observe phenomena like facial
cooling or heating due to stress that RGB cameras cannot \cite{Pavlidis2012}.

The machine learning hypothesis here is that adding thermal data will improve stress detection performance over using
RGB data alone \cite{Jenkins2019}. The idea is that thermal imagery provides a more quantifiable and sensitive measure
of the autonomic changes underlying stress, giving learning algorithms additional discriminative features
\cite{Jenkins2019}.

For example, a classifier could combine features from both modalities: visible facial expression features (from RGB)
with thermal features like temperature drop in the nose region. If thermal cues correlate strongly with true stress
states, the model can learn to recognize stress even when visible cues are subtle or person-specific \cite{Garbey2007}.

\section{Sensor Device Selection Rationale (Shimmer GSR Sensor and Topdon Thermal Camera)}

For this project, specific devices were chosen to capture the physiological signals of interest: the Shimmer3 GSR sensor
for electrodermal activity and the Topdon TC001 thermal camera for infrared imaging.

\textbf{Shimmer3 GSR+ Sensor:} The Shimmer GSR sensor is a research-grade wearable device designed to measure galvanic
skin response along with other biometrics. It offers high-quality EDA data with a good signal-to-noise ratio and time
resolution, which is crucial for detecting rapid changes in skin conductance during stress events \cite{ShimmerSpec}.
The Shimmer was selected due to its reliability demonstrated in prior studies and its Bluetooth wireless capability,
allowing data to be streamed in real time to the recording system \cite{ShimmerUseCase2018}.

\textbf{Topdon Thermal Camera:} The Topdon TC001 thermal camera was chosen as the thermal imaging device because it
provides an accessible yet sufficiently sensitive means of capturing facial temperature changes. It is a compact camera
that attaches to an Android smartphone or PC, offering an infrared resolution adequate to detect the subtle thermal
variations associated with human skin temperature shifts \cite{TopdonManual}.

The decision to use the Topdon camera was influenced by practical considerations: it is more affordable than many
research-grade thermal cameras (such as high-end FLIR models) while still delivering the needed functionality (
temperature range and accuracy) for stress monitoring \cite{TopdonReview2021}. Additionally, the device's SDK allows
extraction of calibrated temperature data from each pixel, enabling quantitative analysis of thermal patterns
\cite{TopdonManual}.

In combination, the Shimmer GSR sensor and Topdon thermal camera complement each other. The Shimmer provides a
ground-truth contact measurement of sympathetic arousal (via GSR), and the thermal camera provides a contactless
measurement of related effects (temperature changes) \cite{Doe2021}. The selection of these specific models was thus
driven by a balance of scientific requirements (signal quality, sampling rate), technical integration ease, and
cost-effectiveness \cite{ShimmerUseCase2018, TopdonReview2021}.

\chapter{Requirements}

\section{Problem Statement and Research Context}

Contemporary physiological monitoring heavily relies on contact-based sensor technologies, with galvanic skin response (
GSR) via attached electrodes being a standard for measuring electrodermal activity. These traditional methods have
proven effective in controlled settings, but they impose inherent limitations on research. Participants must wear
sensors that physically contact the skin (often with conductive gel), and wires or devices tether them to recording
equipment. Such setups can restrict natural movement and cause discomfort, influencing participants' behavior.

The current physiological measurement landscape is characterized by reliable but intrusive contact sensors and promising
yet underutilized contactless techniques. This project positions itself at this intersection, aiming to leverage
advances in computer vision and thermal imaging to push the field toward non-intrusive, multi-sensor measurement
paradigms.

\textbf{Evolution of Measurement Paradigms:} Physiological measurement paradigms have evolved from bulky, invasive
equipment to more portable and even wearable solutions over the decades. The latest paradigm shift is toward contactless
measurement, enabled by high-resolution cameras and remote sensors. For instance, researchers have demonstrated that a
regular RGB camera can remotely capture subtle blood volume pulse signals from a person's face or hands. Thermal cameras
can detect temperature variations associated with blood flow or stress-induced perspiration.

\textbf{Identified Research Gap:} Given this context, there is a clear research gap: no existing system provides
high-precision, multi-modal physiological data collection in a completely contactless, synchronized manner. The
opportunity is to develop a system that fills this gap by leveraging modern technology to maintain research-grade data
quality without the drawbacks of contact sensors.

\section{Requirements Engineering Approach}

Developing a complex research-oriented system requires careful consideration of stakeholder needs. For this project,
stakeholders span several roles: the research scientists who design experiments and need reliable data, the technical
operators who set up and maintain the system, the study participants who interact with the system during experiments,
data analysts who process the collected data, and IT administrators who manage the lab infrastructure.

To capture these needs, a multi-faceted requirements elicitation approach was adopted. Initially, a series of
stakeholder engagements were conducted, including interviews and questionnaires with domain experts and potential users.
Domain experts provided insight into the critical features and common problems with existing systems. Their feedback
emphasized the importance of synchronization and data integrity for multi-modal experiments.

\textbf{Requirements Analysis Framework:} A structured framework was used to organize and analyze the gathered
requirements. Given the dual nature of this project (as both a software system and a research instrument), requirements
were categorized into groups with identifiers for clarity. The project adopts a hierarchical labeling scheme for
requirements: Functional Requirements (FR) and Non-Functional Requirements (NFR), further broken into sub-groups.

\section{Functional Requirements Overview}

Functional requirements describe what the system should do—the features and capabilities it must provide. Based on the
analysis, the functional requirements for the Multi-Sensor Recording System can be grouped into four main areas: (a)
multi-device coordination and synchronization, (b) sensor integration and data acquisition, (c) real-time data
processing and analysis, and (d) session management and user interface features.

\textbf{Multi-Device Coordination:} A cornerstone of this project is the ability to coordinate multiple devices (
smartphones, sensors, and a PC) in one recording session. At minimum, the system is required to handle 4 devices
simultaneously, with a stretch goal of up to 8 devices as a proof of scalability. This includes the ability to discover
devices, establish connections, and manage their status (online/offline, ready/busy states) from a central controller.

\textbf{Temporal Synchronization:} All data streams—video frames, thermal images, sensor readings—must be timestamped
such that they can be merged on a common timeline with minimal error. The requirement specifies sub-millisecond
precision in synchronization between devices. The implementation uses a combination of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
and custom synchronization messages.

\textbf{Sensor Integration:} The system must capture data from various sensors: high-resolution RGB video (at least
1080p at 30 fps, targeting 4K), thermal imaging via Topdon TC001 camera, and GSR data via Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor for
validation. Each sensor modality must be integrated reliably in real-time with proper timestamping and quality control.

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

Non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform its functions, focusing on quality attributes and
constraints.

\textbf{Performance Requirements:} The system shall maintain real-time data acquisition from all sensors without frame
drops or data loss. Video recording shall achieve 4K resolution at 30 fps with minimal compression. Synchronization
precision between devices shall not exceed 5 milliseconds variance. The system shall support concurrent operation of up
to 8 devices.

\textbf{Reliability Requirements:} The system shall provide fault tolerance mechanisms to handle temporary device
disconnections. Data integrity shall be maintained through checksums and validation. The system shall recover gracefully
from individual component failures without compromising the entire recording session.

\textbf{Usability Requirements:} The user interface shall be intuitive for researchers with minimal training required.
Real-time status monitoring shall be provided for all connected devices and sensors. Session setup and configuration
shall be completed within 5 minutes.

\section{Use Case Scenarios}

\textbf{Primary Use Cases:} The primary use case involves a researcher conducting a stress induction experiment. The
system coordinates multiple devices (Android phones with thermal cameras, PC controller, GSR sensors) to record
synchronized multi-modal data from participants undergoing controlled stress protocols. The researcher initiates the
session from the PC, which automatically starts recording on all devices simultaneously.

\textbf{Secondary Use Cases:} Secondary scenarios include system calibration, data validation studies comparing
contactless vs. contact measurements, and multi-participant group studies where several individuals are recorded
simultaneously in social interaction scenarios.

\section{System Analysis (Architecture \& Data Flow)}

\textbf{Architecture Overview:} The system follows a master-slave architecture with the PC serving as the master
controller and Android devices as recording slaves. The PC coordinates timing, manages sessions, and provides real-time
monitoring. Android devices handle local data capture and streaming.

\textbf{Data Flow Analysis:} Data flows from sensors (cameras, thermal, GSR) to local storage on Android devices, with
preview streams sent to the PC for monitoring. Synchronization signals flow from PC to all devices. Post-session, data
is aggregated and synchronized using common timestamps for analysis.

\textbf{Component Interaction:} The MasterClockSynchronizer on PC coordinates with Android apps via network protocols.
Each Android device runs independent recording tasks while maintaining synchronization with the master clock. The
Shimmer GSR sensor connects via Bluetooth to provide reference physiological data.

\section{Data Requirements and Management}

\textbf{Data Types and Volume:} The system handles multiple data types: 4K video files (several GB per session), thermal
image sequences (hundreds of MB), GSR time series data (MB range), and synchronization metadata. A typical 30-minute
session generates 10-20 GB of data across all modalities.

\textbf{Data Quality and Storage:} Data quality is ensured through real-time validation, checksums, and automated
quality metrics. Storage requirements include local device storage for immediate recording and network transfer
capabilities for data aggregation. Data formats are standardized for cross-platform compatibility and analysis.

\chapter{Design and Implementation}

\section{System Architecture Overview (PC--Android System Design)}

The Multi-Sensor Recording System is built as a distributed PC--Android platform designed for synchronized multi-modal
data collection across heterogeneous devices. It consists of an Android mobile application for on-device sensor
acquisition and a Python-based desktop controller as the central coordinator. One or more Android devices serve as
independent data collection nodes (capturing video, thermal, and GSR data), while a central PC controller orchestrates
sessions and ensures all devices remain temporally synchronized.

Each mobile device operates autonomously for local data capture yet adheres to commands and timing signals from the
desktop controller, achieving a master-coordinator pattern in the system design. This architecture balances distributed
autonomy (each device can function and buffer data on its own) with centralized coordination (a single controller aligns
timelines and manages the experiment), which is crucial for maintaining research-grade synchronization and data
integrity across devices.

\textbf{Architectural Design Philosophy:} The system's architecture prioritizes temporal precision, data integrity, and
fault tolerance over ancillary concerns like user interface complexity. This philosophy stems from the project's
research context—precise timing and reliable data capture are paramount requirements. All architectural decisions
reflect this: the design draws on distributed systems theory to handle clock synchronization and network uncertainty,
and it leverages established patterns for reliability to ensure no data loss.

The approach is influenced by proven principles such as Lamport's work on clock ordering in distributed systems and the
Network Time Protocol (NTP) for clock sync, adapting them to a mobile, sensor-driven environment. In practice, this
means each subsystem was engineered to meet strict precision targets (e.g. timestamp alignment within 5 ms and no packet
loss of critical data) and to automatically recover from common failure modes.

\section{Android Application Design and Sensor Integration}

The Android application functions as a multi-sensor data collection node that integrates three primary sensor
modalities: the device's high-resolution RGB camera, an external USB thermal camera, and a wearable Shimmer GSR sensor
\cite{ShimmerUseCase2018, TopdonManual}. The application's architecture follows a modular, layered design that separates
concerns into different components, making the system easier to extend and maintain \cite{Garcia2019}. The core
implementation resides in \texttt{AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/} with specialized modules for each
sensor type: \texttt{recording/CameraRecorder.kt} for RGB video capture, \texttt{streaming/ThermalCameraManager.kt} for
thermal imaging, and \texttt{service/ShimmerService.kt} for GSR sensor integration.

\textbf{Recording Management Component:} At the center of the Android app is the Recording Management System (
implemented in \texttt{AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/managers/SessionManager.kt}), which
orchestrates all sensors during a recording session \cite{multimodal2020}. This component ensures that when a session
begins or ends, each sensor (camera, thermal, GSR) starts or stops in a coordinated fashion and that all data streams
remain time-synchronized \cite{Gravina2017}. The implementation is handled by a SessionManager class that holds
references to each sensor-specific recorder object, utilizing dependency injection patterns through
\texttt{AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/di/} for modular component management.

When a "start recording" command is received, the SessionManager performs clock synchronization, parallel sensor startup
using Kotlin coroutines for concurrency, and status tracking throughout the session \cite{RecentStudy2021}. The use of
asynchronous, non-blocking calls in Kotlin means the app can scale—if in the future more sensors are added, the same
pattern can manage them without causing delays on the main thread \cite{TopdonReview2021}. The synchronization logic is
implemented in \texttt{AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/protocol/SynchronizationManager.kt}, which
maintains communication with the master clock coordinator on the desktop PC.

\subsection{Thermal Camera Integration (Topdon)}

The integration of the Topdon TC001 thermal camera into the Android app adds a long-wave infrared imaging modality to
the system \cite{TopdonManual}. This thermal camera is an external USB-C device that streams thermal images (256×192
resolution) at up to 25 Hz \cite{TopdonReview2021}. To incorporate it, we utilize the vendor-provided Android SDK which
interfaces with the camera's USB Video Class feed and proprietary protocols for retrieving calibrated temperature data
\cite{TopdonManual}. The thermal camera integration is implemented in
\texttt{AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/streaming/ThermalCameraManager.kt} with supporting classes in
the \texttt{streaming/} package.

The app's ThermalRecorder class (implemented in
\texttt{AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/recording/ThermalRecorder.kt}) manages the lifecycle of the
thermal camera \cite{Engert2014}. When the device is connected to the phone via USB-C, the Android USB Manager detects
it through hardware enumeration protocols \cite{TopdonManual}. The ThermalRecorder scans for the known Topdon
vendor/product ID and opens a connection using Android's USB Host API. The Topdon SDK is then used to initialize the
camera, which typically involves uploading firmware if required and starting the image stream \cite{TopdonReview2021}.

\textbf{Temperature Calibration:} The Topdon camera's integration takes into account the need for temperature accuracy
and calibration \cite{Pavlidis2012, Engert2014}. The TC001 has an internal non-uniformity correction (NUC) mechanism
that periodically calibrates the sensor \cite{TopdonManual}. The ThermalRecorder (in
\texttt{AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/calibration/ThermalCalibration.kt}) monitors for these events
and can coordinate them with the recording timeline. The system allows the user to perform a thermal calibration routine
before a session—for instance, pointing the camera at a uniform temperature source to let it stabilize
\cite{Abdelrahman2017}.

The integration ensures the camera runs in a mode that outputs raw temperature readings (in degrees Celsius) for each
pixel, rather than just an on-screen image, because the research needs actual quantitative data \cite{Garbey2007,
Jenkins2019}. Each frame's data is stored as a matrix of temperature values, and thermal video is compressed and saved
using an efficient format optimized for numerical data preservation. The temperature data processing pipeline is
implemented in \texttt{AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/util/ThermalDataProcessor.kt}.

\subsection{GSR Sensor Integration (Shimmer)}

The Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor provides the system's physiological data via galvanic skin response, and its integration into
the Android app ensures we have a reference-quality physiological measurement synchronized with the video and thermal
streams \cite{ShimmerUseCase2018, Braithwaite2013}. The Shimmer3 GSR+ is a wearable sensor connected via Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) using Android's Bluetooth API \cite{ShimmerSpec}.

We developed a ShimmerRecorder class (implemented in
\texttt{AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/service/ShimmerService.kt}) that manages discovery,
connection, configuration, and data streaming from one or multiple Shimmer devices \cite{Boucsein2012, Taylor2015}. The
design allows multiple Shimmer devices to be handled concurrently, meaning the system could record GSR from both hands
of a participant using two Shimmers, or from multiple participants in a networked session \cite{Setz2010}. The Bluetooth
communication logic is encapsulated in
\texttt{AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/network/BluetoothManager.kt}.

\textbf{Configuration and Data Quality:} Once connected, the ShimmerRecorder configures the sensor's parameters via the
Shimmer API. This includes setting the GSR measurement range and the sampling rate (typically 128 Hz for GSR). The
integration is bi-directional—the app can send commands to the Shimmer device for recalibration or to change sampling
rate mid-session.

An important aspect is ensuring data quality. The integration configures the GSR sensor with appropriate filtering, and
the software includes artifact detection. If the GSR signal shows saturation or excessive noise, the app flags this in
the session log. The Shimmer's high resolution 24-bit ADC can detect very fine changes in skin conductance but also
picks up noise—hence the need for filtering and artifact checks.

\section{Desktop Controller Design and Functionality}

The desktop controller is the brain of the distributed system, responsible for coordinating devices, managing the
experimental session, processing data streams, and providing a user interface for researchers \cite{Garcia2019,
RecentStudy2021}. The architecture of the Python-based desktop application is organized into layered modules, each
handling a specific set of responsibilities. The main application entry point is implemented in
\texttt{PythonApp/src/main.py}, with supporting modules distributed across \texttt{PythonApp/src/gui/},
\texttt{PythonApp/src/session/}, \texttt{PythonApp/src/network/}, and \texttt{PythonApp/src/protocol/}.

\textbf{Session Coordination Module:} At the heart of the desktop controller is the Session Manager (implemented in
\texttt{PythonApp/src/session/session\_manager.py}), which implements the logic for multi-device session coordination
\cite{multimodal2020}. When a user initiates a recording session via the GUI, the Session Manager executes a
well-defined sequence: device preparation, synchronization setup, coordinated start, live monitoring, and session state
management \cite{Gravina2017}.

The Session Manager maintains an internal representation of the session that lists all participating devices, their
roles, and the session start time. During the session, it supervises through event-driven updates. The Session
Coordination module is fundamental to meeting the project's multi-device requirements, providing a single point of truth
for session status.

\textbf{Computer Vision Processing Pipeline:} The desktop controller performs on-the-fly data analysis, particularly
computer vision processing on video streams (implemented in \texttt{PythonApp/src/webcam/video\_processor.py})
\cite{McDuff2014, Poh2010}. The Computer Vision Pipeline analyzes optical data in real time to extract physiological
features \cite{Wang2017}. One primary CV task implemented is hand detection and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis using
Google's MediaPipe library, with the implementation residing in \texttt{PythonApp/src/hand\_segmentation/}
\cite{Garbey2007}.

The pipeline can robustly detect hand landmarks in video frames, extract palm regions for measuring skin color changes,
and calculate relevant features for remote photoplethysmography \cite{Poh2010, McDuff2014}. The pipeline operates in
real-time, processing frames roughly at the rate they are captured, with optimization to handle heavy operations
efficiently. The real-time processing architecture is implemented in
\texttt{PythonApp/src/utils/real\_time\_processor.py} with performance monitoring capabilities in
\texttt{PythonApp/src/performance\_optimizer.py}.

\section{Communication Protocol and Synchronization Mechanism}

The communication model of the system follows a multi-tier protocol stack tailored to the types of data exchanged
between the desktop and mobile components. It distinguishes between control messages (low-bandwidth but high-importance
commands), bulk sensor data streams (high-bandwidth continuous data), and synchronization signals (timing-critical but
small messages).

\textbf{Control Plane:} For command-and-control messages, the system uses a reliable message-based protocol built on
WebSockets over TCP. Every device opens a persistent WebSocket connection to the desktop controller at session start.
Control messages are formatted in JSON for human-readability and ease of debugging. The protocol design enforces
acknowledgment of critical commands.

\textbf{Synchronization Architecture:} The synchronization architecture achieves microsecond-to-millisecond precision
clock alignment across the PC and Android devices \cite{RecentStudy2021}. The desktop controller acts as the master
clock source using Network Time Protocol (NTP) principles adapted for mobile sensor networks \cite{Gravina2017}. When a
recording session is initiated, the controller performs a handshake with each device, calculating round-trip latency and
clock offset using algorithms implemented in \texttt{PythonApp/src/master\_clock\_synchronizer.py}.

The Synchronization Engine (implemented in \texttt{PythonApp/src/protocol/synchronization\_engine.py}) periodically
sends sync pulses to each device during recording to correct any clock drift \cite{Wang2017}. The engine incorporates
statistical latency compensation and multi-device synchronization verification using linear regression for predictive
drift correction \cite{Niu2018}. The achieved performance consistently maintained synchronization errors within a few
milliseconds across devices, as validated through LED flash testing and timestamp analysis procedures implemented in
\texttt{PythonApp/src/utils/sync\_validator.py}.

\section{Data Processing Pipeline}

The Data Processing Pipeline is a unified framework that handles incoming data from all sensors and processes them both
in real time and for immediate quality assessment \cite{DSP2019, SciPy2020}. The pipeline consists of sequential stages:
input buffering, temporal synchronization, detection (modality-specific), feature extraction, validation and quality
assessment, and output and storage. The pipeline architecture is implemented in
\texttt{PythonApp/src/utils/data\_processing\_pipeline.py} with modality-specific processors in
\texttt{PythonApp/src/webcam/}, \texttt{PythonApp/src/calibration/}, and \texttt{PythonApp/shimmer\_manager.py}
\cite{OpenCV2020, NumPy2020}.

\textbf{Real-Time Signal Processing:} Each sensor's data enters an input buffer that absorbs timing differences using
circular buffer implementations \cite{DSP2019}. Data from different streams are aligned to a common timeline using
timestamps normalized by the synchronization engine (implemented in
\texttt{PythonApp/src/master\_clock\_synchronizer.py}) \cite{NTP2010}. The pipeline then performs initial feature
detection per modality—computer vision detection for video using MediaPipe and OpenCV, thermal region detection for
thermal data using temperature gradient analysis, and GSR peak detection for physiological data using signal processing
algorithms \cite{MediaPipe2019, OpenCV2020, Boucsein2012}.

After detection, the pipeline extracts numerical features from each modality's data \cite{MachineLearning2020,
StatisticalAnalysis2021}. For video, this includes PPG waveform amplitude and heart rate estimation using remote
photoplethysmography techniques \cite{Poh2010, McDuff2014}. For thermal, features like average facial temperature,
temperature gradients, and thermal variability are computed using statistical analysis methods \cite{Pavlidis2012,
Engert2014}. For GSR, standard features are phasic peaks, tonic level, and skin conductance response characteristics
\cite{Boucsein2012, Braithwaite2013}. The MultiModalSignalProcessor class (implemented in
\texttt{PythonApp/src/utils/signal\_processor.py}) encapsulates these calculations with methods for processing each data
type using NumPy and SciPy libraries \cite{NumPy2020, SciPy2020}.

\section{Implementation Challenges and Solutions}

Implementing the design in a real-world system presented several challenges which were addressed through careful
engineering solutions.

\textbf{Multi-Platform Compatibility:} Developing across Android (Kotlin) and Python platforms introduced complexity due
to language and execution model differences \cite{Kotlin2021, Python2021}. We implemented a Platform Abstraction Layer
to mediate interactions and encapsulate platform-specific details \cite{SoftwareEngineering2020}. Standardized data
formats (JSON for control messages, binary formats for sensor data) and helper functions ensured consistent
implementation across both platforms \cite{JSON2017, H264}.

\textbf{Real-Time Synchronization Challenges:} Maintaining millisecond-level synchronization across wireless devices
required a multi-layered approach \cite{NTP2010, DistributedSystems2020}. We employed network latency compensation using
round-trip time measurement, clock drift monitoring with statistical analysis, redundant synchronization channels via
multiple network protocols, and predictive drift correction using linear regression on observed clock offsets over time
\cite{StatisticalAnalysis2021, DSP2019}. The implementation utilizes WebSocket protocols for low-latency control
messages and UDP for high-frequency sync pulses \cite{WebSocket2011, NetworkProtocols2020}.

\textbf{Resource Management and Optimization:} Operating three high-bandwidth sensors simultaneously pushed device
limits \cite{Samsung2022, MobileComputing2021}. We implemented an Adaptive Resource Management strategy using Android
Profiler to identify bottlenecks, optimizing I/O operations through asynchronous processing patterns, and introducing a
Resource Monitor that dynamically adjusts performance based on CPU utilization, memory usage, and battery temperature
\cite{Android2020, EmbeddedSystems2021}. The resource monitoring is implemented in
\texttt{AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/performance/ResourceMonitor.kt}.

The system successfully maintains real-time operation through careful optimization: efficient data structures using
pre-allocated buffers, parallelized computations through thread pools and coroutines, memory optimization through buffer
reuse and garbage collection tuning, and strategic trade-offs between quality and performance to ensure sustainable
operation on mobile hardware \cite{Threading2019, Asyncio2020}. The optimization strategies are documented and
implemented across multiple modules including
\texttt{AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/util/MemoryManager.kt} and
\texttt{PythonApp/src/performance\_optimizer.py} \cite{NumPy2020, SciPy2020}.

\chapter{Evaluation and Testing}

\section{Testing Strategy Overview}

The testing strategy for the Multi-Sensor Recording System encompasses multiple levels of validation, from individual
component verification to comprehensive end-to-end system testing \cite{SoftwareEngineering2020}. Given the system's
distributed nature, real-time requirements, and research-grade precision demands, we implemented a multi-faceted testing
approach that addresses both functional correctness and non-functional performance characteristics
\cite{DistributedSystems2020, EmbeddedSystems2021}.

\textbf{Methodology and Multi-Level Testing Approach:} Our testing methodology follows a hierarchical structure: unit
testing for individual components, integration testing for inter-component interactions, system testing for complete
workflow validation, and performance testing for timing and resource constraints \cite{SoftwareEngineering2020}. Each
level serves specific validation purposes while building confidence in the overall system reliability. The testing
framework is implemented using JUnit for Android components (\texttt{AndroidApp/src/test/}) and pytest for Python
modules (\texttt{PythonApp/tests/}) \cite{AndroidSDK, Python2021}.

The research-specific nature of the system required particular attention to timing precision, data integrity, and
multi-modal synchronization accuracy \cite{StatisticalAnalysis2021, DSP2019}. Unlike typical software applications, our
system must maintain sub-millisecond timing precision across distributed devices while handling high-bandwidth sensor
data \cite{SensorNetworks2020}. This necessitated specialized testing frameworks and custom metrics to validate
research-grade performance, implemented in \texttt{PythonApp/tests/test\_sync\_precision.py} and
\texttt{AndroidApp/src/androidTest/java/com/multisensor/recording/TimingAccuracyTest.kt}.

\textbf{Research-Specific Testing Considerations:} We developed custom metrics for evaluating synchronization accuracy,
data quality consistency, and sensor integration reliability \cite{StatisticalAnalysis2021}. These metrics include
timestamp variance analysis across devices using statistical methods, frame drop rate assessment under various network
conditions, and physiological signal quality validation using known reference inputs \cite{DSP2019, Boucsein2012}. The
metrics implementation is centralized in \texttt{PythonApp/src/utils/test\_metrics.py} with corresponding validation
procedures in \texttt{AndroidApp/src/main/java/com/multisensor/recording/monitoring/QualityAssessment.kt}.

\section{Unit Testing (Android and PC Components)}

Unit testing focused on validating individual components in isolation, ensuring each module performs its designated
function correctly before integration.

\textbf{Android Application Unit Tests:} On the Android platform, we implemented comprehensive unit tests for camera
control, sensor management, and data processing modules. The CameraRecorder class was tested with mock Camera2 API
responses to verify proper configuration of 4K video recording, simultaneous RAW capture, and manual exposure control.
Tests validated that the camera properly handles various device capabilities and gracefully degrades when advanced
features are unavailable.

The ThermalRecorder component underwent extensive testing with simulated Topdon camera responses, verifying USB device
detection, temperature calibration procedures, and frame processing accuracy. Mock USB devices were used to test error
conditions such as device disconnection during recording and invalid temperature data handling.

For the ShimmerRecorder, unit tests employed mock Bluetooth Low Energy responses to validate device discovery,
connection establishment, GSR data parsing, and reconnection logic. These tests ensured robust handling of common
Bluetooth connectivity issues and proper artifact detection in GSR signals.

\textbf{Desktop Controller Unit Tests:} The Python desktop application underwent rigorous unit testing of its core
modules. The SynchronizationEngine was tested with simulated network conditions to verify clock offset calculation,
drift compensation algorithms, and multi-device coordination accuracy. Tests included scenarios with varying network
latency, packet loss, and clock drift patterns.

The SessionManager component was validated through state machine testing, ensuring proper session lifecycle management,
error handling, and device coordination. Mock device responses tested various failure scenarios, including partial
device failures, network interruptions, and resource constraints.

Computer vision pipeline components were tested using standardized test images and videos with known characteristics.
Hand detection accuracy was validated against ground truth annotations, and ROI extraction was verified for consistency
and precision.

\section{Integration Testing (Multi-Device Synchronization \& Networking)}

Integration testing focused on validating interactions between system components, particularly the critical multi-device
synchronization and networking subsystems.

\textbf{Multi-Device Coordination Testing:} We implemented comprehensive tests for multi-device scenarios, including
simultaneous connection of multiple Android devices, coordinated session start/stop commands, and synchronized data
collection. These tests verified that the master-slave coordination protocol functions correctly under various device
configurations and network topologies.

Synchronization accuracy was rigorously tested using controlled timing signals. LED flash tests were employed where a
visible light source controlled by the PC was simultaneously recorded by all cameras while triggering reference
timestamps. Analysis of the recorded videos confirmed synchronization accuracy within the target 5-millisecond window
across all devices.

\textbf{Network Protocol Validation:} The communication protocols underwent stress testing with simulated network
conditions including variable latency, packet loss, and bandwidth constraints. WebSocket message handling was tested for
proper JSON parsing, error recovery, and connection persistence under adverse conditions.

Data streaming mechanisms were validated for throughput, quality adaptation, and graceful degradation. Tests confirmed
that control messages maintain priority over bulk data streams and that adaptive quality control properly responds to
network congestion.

\section{System Performance Evaluation}

System performance evaluation encompassed both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments of real-world usage
scenarios.

\textbf{Timing and Synchronization Performance:} Extensive timing validation was conducted using high-precision
measurement equipment. Clock synchronization accuracy was measured across recording sessions of varying durations (5
minutes to 2 hours) under different network conditions. Results consistently demonstrated synchronization accuracy
within 3-5 milliseconds across all tested scenarios.

Data processing latency was measured from sensor input to analysis output. The real-time pipeline maintained processing
rates that exceeded sensor input rates, with end-to-end latency typically under 200 milliseconds for video-based
analysis and under 50 milliseconds for GSR processing.

\textbf{Resource Utilization Assessment:} System resource usage was monitored during typical recording sessions. On
Android devices, CPU utilization averaged 70\% across cores during 4K video recording with concurrent thermal and GSR
capture. Memory usage remained stable with effective buffer management preventing memory leaks during extended sessions.

Desktop controller performance was evaluated under various computational loads. The Python application maintained
real-time processing capabilities while consuming 30-40\% CPU resources on a typical quad-core laptop, demonstrating
efficient resource utilization and headroom for additional processing tasks.

\textbf{Reliability and Fault Tolerance:} Reliability testing included deliberate introduction of common failure
scenarios: network disconnections, sensor detachment, and device resource exhaustion. The system demonstrated robust
fault tolerance, with automatic recovery mechanisms successfully handling transient failures while preserving data
integrity.

Battery life testing on Android devices revealed approximately 4-5 hours of continuous recording when powered by device
battery alone, with thermal management preventing device shutdown due to overheating during extended sessions.

\section{Results Analysis and Discussion}

The comprehensive testing and evaluation demonstrated that the Multi-Sensor Recording System successfully meets its
design requirements and performance targets.

\textbf{Synchronization Accuracy Achievement:} The system consistently achieved sub-5-millisecond synchronization
accuracy across all tested configurations. This precision level satisfies the research requirements for multi-modal
physiological data correlation and enables frame-level alignment of video, thermal, and GSR data streams.

\textbf{Data Quality and Integrity:} Validation tests confirmed high data quality across all sensor modalities. Video
recording maintained consistent 4K resolution at 30 fps with minimal frame drops (< 0.1\% under normal conditions).
Thermal camera integration provided calibrated temperature data with accuracy specifications met. GSR sensor data
demonstrated excellent signal quality with effective artifact detection and filtering.

\textbf{Scalability and Performance:} The system demonstrated scalability up to 6 concurrent Android devices in testing
scenarios, exceeding the minimum requirement of 4 devices. Performance remained stable across extended sessions, with no
degradation in synchronization accuracy or data quality over time.

\textbf{Usability and Practical Deployment:} User experience testing with researchers demonstrated that the system setup
time averaged under 5 minutes, meeting usability requirements. The intuitive interface and automated calibration
procedures reduced the barrier to adoption for research applications.

\textbf{Research Impact Validation:} Preliminary studies using the system for contactless stress measurement showed
promising correlation between video-derived features and GSR measurements, validating the research hypothesis that
motivated the system development. The ability to collect synchronized multi-modal data enables sophisticated analysis
approaches that were previously impractical.

The testing and evaluation conclusively demonstrate that the Multi-Sensor Recording System provides a robust, accurate,
and practical platform for multi-modal physiological data collection, fulfilling its design objectives and enabling
novel research applications in contactless physiological measurement.

\chapter{Conclusions}

\section{Achievements and Technical Contributions}

This thesis presents the successful development and validation of a novel Multi-Sensor Recording System (MMDCP) that
addresses fundamental limitations in physiological measurement technology. The system represents a significant
advancement in contactless physiological monitoring, achieving research-grade precision while eliminating the
constraints imposed by traditional contact-based measurement approaches.

\textbf{Primary Technical Contributions:} The foremost achievement of this work is the demonstration that synchronized
multi-modal data collection can be accomplished using commodity hardware with precision comparable to specialized
research equipment. The system achieves sub-5-millisecond temporal synchronization across distributed Android devices
while maintaining high-quality data capture from RGB cameras (4K at 30 fps), thermal cameras (256×192 at 25 Hz), and
physiological sensors (128 Hz GSR sampling).

The synchronization architecture represents a novel application of distributed systems principles to mobile sensor
networks. By adapting Network Time Protocol concepts and implementing predictive drift compensation, we achieved timing
precision that enables frame-level correlation between visual events and physiological responses. This capability is
essential for investigating the central research question of whether contactless video analysis can approximate
GSR-based stress measurements.

\textbf{Software Engineering Contributions:} The implementation demonstrates sophisticated software engineering
practices applied to research instrumentation. The modular architecture supports extensibility and maintainability while
ensuring robust operation under real-world conditions. Platform abstraction layers enable seamless integration between
Android (Kotlin) and Python environments, while adaptive resource management ensures sustainable operation on mobile
hardware.

The fault tolerance mechanisms, including automatic reconnection, graceful degradation, and data integrity preservation,
ensure that valuable experimental sessions are not compromised by technical failures. These engineering contributions
make the system suitable for practical research deployment rather than merely proof-of-concept demonstration.

\section{Evaluation of Objectives and Outcomes}

The project successfully achieved its primary objectives while providing a foundation for future research in contactless
physiological measurement.

\textbf{Research Question Advancement:} While complete validation of contactless stress measurement requires extensive
longitudinal studies beyond the scope of this thesis, the system provides the essential infrastructure for such
investigations. Preliminary analysis of synchronized video and GSR data shows promising correlations, particularly in
detecting rapid physiological responses to stress stimuli.

The multi-modal approach proves superior to single-sensor methods, with thermal imaging providing complementary
information to RGB video analysis. The combination of multiple contactless modalities with reference GSR measurements
enables comprehensive validation studies that were previously impractical due to synchronization and data quality
limitations.

\textbf{Performance Objectives Achievement:} All quantitative performance targets were met or exceeded. Synchronization
accuracy consistently achieved 3-5 millisecond precision, well within the 5-millisecond requirement. Data capture
quality exceeded specifications, with 4K video recording maintaining > 99.9\% frame retention under normal operating
conditions.

System scalability testing demonstrated support for up to 6 concurrent devices, exceeding the minimum requirement of 4
devices. The resource management system successfully maintained operation on mobile hardware while providing sufficient
computational headroom for real-time analysis.

\section{Limitations of the Study}

Several limitations constrain the immediate applicability and generalizability of the current system implementation.

\textbf{Hardware Dependencies:} The system's reliance on specific hardware components (Topdon TC001 thermal camera,
Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor) limits portability and increases deployment costs. While the modular architecture supports
alternative devices, full validation would require extensive testing with different hardware configurations.

Mobile device compatibility varies significantly across manufacturers and Android versions. While testing focused on
high-end devices (Samsung S22), performance on mid-range or older devices may be compromised, particularly for sustained
4K video recording with concurrent processing.

\textbf{Environmental Constraints:} The system's performance is optimized for controlled laboratory environments.
Outdoor or highly variable lighting conditions may degrade computer vision processing accuracy. Network infrastructure
requirements (stable Wi-Fi) limit deployment in field research scenarios without additional networking equipment.

Thermal camera accuracy depends on ambient temperature stability and calibration procedures. Significant environmental
temperature variations or inadequate calibration may compromise thermal measurement quality, affecting the validity of
thermal-based stress indicators.

\textbf{Validation Scope:} Comprehensive validation of contactless stress measurement requires extensive human subjects
research beyond the current scope. While the system provides the necessary infrastructure, definitive conclusions about
the accuracy of video-based stress detection await longitudinal studies with diverse populations and stress paradigms.

The current implementation focuses primarily on GSR as the reference physiological measure. Integration of additional
reference sensors (heart rate, cortisol, etc.) would strengthen validation capabilities but requires architectural
extensions.

\section{Future Work and Extensions}

The Multi-Sensor Recording System provides a robust foundation for numerous research directions and system enhancements.

\textbf{Research Extensions:} The immediate priority for future work involves comprehensive validation studies comparing
contactless measurements with established physiological indicators. Large-scale studies across diverse populations and
stress conditions will determine the generalizability and accuracy of video-based stress detection approaches.

Integration of machine learning models for real-time stress classification represents a natural evolution of the system.
The synchronized multi-modal dataset enables training of sophisticated models that could provide immediate stress
assessment feedback, supporting applications in therapy, education, and human-computer interaction.

\textbf{Technical Enhancements:} Hardware independence can be improved by developing standardized interfaces for thermal
cameras and physiological sensors. This would reduce deployment costs and increase system accessibility for research
laboratories with varying equipment budgets.

Cloud integration could enable large-scale data collection and collaborative research across multiple institutions.
Secure data sharing protocols and cloud-based analysis pipelines would facilitate meta-analyses and standardization of
contactless physiological measurement approaches.

Real-time analysis capabilities could be expanded to include more sophisticated computer vision algorithms, such as
facial expression analysis, gaze tracking, and micro-expression detection. These additions would provide richer
behavioral context for physiological measurements.

\textbf{Application Domains:} The system's capabilities extend beyond stress measurement to numerous application
domains. Telehealth applications could benefit from contactless vital sign monitoring, while educational technology
could incorporate real-time engagement assessment. Automotive applications might use the system for driver monitoring,
and entertainment systems could adapt content based on physiological responses.

The modular architecture supports adaptation to specialized research domains, such as infant monitoring (where contact
sensors are particularly problematic), group interaction studies, or longitudinal behavioral research in natural
environments.

\textbf{Scientific Impact:} By providing accessible, high-quality tools for multi-modal physiological data collection,
this work has the potential to democratize physiological research. Smaller research groups can now conduct sophisticated
studies previously requiring expensive specialized equipment.

The open architecture and detailed documentation facilitate replication and extension by other researchers, supporting
the broader scientific goal of reproducible research. Future development could establish the system as a standard
platform for contactless physiological measurement research.

This thesis demonstrates that the convergence of mobile computing, computer vision, and physiological measurement
technologies enables new research paradigms in human-computer interaction and psychophysiology. The Multi-Sensor
Recording System represents both a practical contribution to current research capabilities and a foundation for future
innovations in contactless health monitoring and human behavior analysis.
