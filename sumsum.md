\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation and Research Context}

Stress is a ubiquitous physiological and psychological response with profound implications for human-computer interaction (HCI), health monitoring, and emotion recognition. In contexts ranging from adaptive user interfaces to mental health assessment, the ability to measure a user's stress level reliably and unobtrusively is highly valuable. Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), also known as electrodermal activity, is a well-established index of stress and arousal, reflecting changes in sweat gland activity via skin conductance measurements \cite{Boucsein2012}. Traditional GSR monitoring techniques, however, rely on attaching electrodes to the skin (typically on the fingers or palm) to sense minute electrical conductance changes \cite{Fowles1981}. 

While effective in controlled laboratory settings, this contact-based approach has significant drawbacks: the physical sensors can be obtrusive and uncomfortable, often altering natural user behaviour and emotional states \cite{Cacioppo2007}. In other words, the very act of measuring stress via contact sensors may itself induce stress or otherwise confound the measurements, raising concerns about ecological validity in HCI and ambulatory health scenarios \cite{Wilhelm2010}. Moreover, contact sensors tether participants to devices, limiting mobility and making longitudinal or real-world monitoring cumbersome. These limitations motivate the pursuit of contactless stress measurement methods that can capture stress-related signals without any physical attachments, thereby preserving natural behaviour and comfort.

The Multi-Sensor Recording System emerges from the rapidly evolving field of contactless physiological measurement, representing a significant advancement in research instrumentation that addresses fundamental limitations of traditional electrode-based approaches. Pioneering work in noncontact physiological measurement using webcams has demonstrated the potential for camera-based monitoring \cite{poh2010noncontact}, while advances in biomedical engineering have established the theoretical foundations for remote physiological detection. The research context encompasses the intersection of distributed systems engineering, mobile computing, computer vision, and psychophysiological measurement, requiring sophisticated integration of diverse technological domains to achieve research-grade precision and reliability.

\section{Research Problem and Objectives}

Recent advances in sensing and computer vision suggest that it may be feasible to infer physiological stress responses using ordinary cameras and imaging devices, completely bypassing the need for electrode contact \cite{Picard2001}. Prior work in affective computing and physiological computing has demonstrated that various visual cues—facial expressions, skin pallor, perspiration, subtle head or body movements—can correlate with emotional arousal and stress levels \cite{Healey2005}. Thermal infrared imaging of the face, for instance, can reveal temperature changes associated with blood flow variations under stress (e.g., cooling of the nose tip due to vasoconstriction) in a fully non-contact manner. 

Likewise, high-resolution RGB video can capture heart rate or breathing rate through imperceptible skin color fluctuations and movements, as shown in emerging remote photoplethysmography techniques \cite{Poh2010}. These developments raise a critical research question at the intersection of computer vision and psychophysiology: Can we approximate or even predict a person's GSR-based stress measurements using only contactless video data from an RGB camera? In other words, does a simple video recording of an individual contain sufficient information to estimate their physiological stress response, obviating the need for dedicated skin contact sensors?

Answering this question affirmatively would have far-reaching implications. It would enable widely accessible stress monitoring (using ubiquitous smartphone or laptop cameras) and seamless integration of stress detection into everyday human-computer interactions and health monitoring applications, without the burden of wearables or electrodes.

To investigate this question, we have developed a multi-sensor data acquisition platform, named \textit{MMDCP}, which enables synchronized recording of physiological signals and video from multiple devices. The system architecture spans two tightly integrated components: a custom Android mobile application and a desktop PC application. The Android app operates on a modern smartphone (e.g., Samsung S22) equipped with an attachable thermal camera module. It simultaneously captures two video streams—a thermal infrared video feed and a standard high-definition RGB video feed from the phone's camera—providing rich visual data of the subject.

The mobile app also offers a user-friendly interface for participants or researchers to manage the recording session (e.g., start/stop recording, view status indicators) on the device. Complementing the mobile device, the desktop PC application (implemented in Python with a graphical user interface) functions as the master controller of the data collection session. The PC connects via Bluetooth to a Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor, a wearable GSR device, to record the participant's skin conductance in real time.

\section{Thesis Outline}

Using the \textit{MMDCP} platform, we conducted a controlled experiment to gather data for evaluating the central research question. In the study, human participants underwent a stress induction protocol while being recorded by the system. We adopted a standardized stimulus known to elicit psychological stress—for example, a time-pressured mental arithmetic task or the Trier Social Stress Test (which combines public speaking and cognitive challenges)—in order to invoke measurable changes in the participants' stress levels.

Throughout each session, the system logged three synchronized data streams: (1) continuous GSR signals from the Shimmer sensor attached to the participant's fingers (serving as the ground-truth indicator of physiological stress response), (2) thermal video of the participant's face and upper body (capturing heat patterns and blood flow changes, which may reflect stress-induced thermoregulatory effects), and (3) RGB video of the participant (capturing visible cues such as facial expressions, skin color changes, or fidgeting behaviours).

This thesis addresses a critical gap in physiological computing by exploring a contactless approach to stress measurement. We have built a novel platform that synchronizes thermal imaging, optical video, and GSR sensing in real time, enabling controlled experiments on stress detection. We leverage this platform to investigate whether visual data alone can serve as a proxy for electrodermal activity in stress assessment. 

The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows: Chapter~2 reviews the background and literature review, including the psychophysiology of stress responses, traditional GSR measurement techniques and their limitations, and recent advances in contactless physiological monitoring. Chapter~3 defines the requirements of the system and details the design and architecture of the \textit{MMDCP} platform, with emphasis on the synchronization strategy and system components. Chapter~4 covers the implementation and technical contributions of the project, describing the software development of the Android and PC applications and the integration of the various sensors and cameras. Chapter~5 then presents the experimental methodology and data analysis, including the stress induction scenario, feature extraction from video, and the results of modeling GSR from video data. Finally, Chapter~6 concludes the thesis, discussing the findings with respect to the research question, the limitations of the current approach, and potential directions for future research in contactless stress detection and multi-modal sensing systems.

\chapter{Background and Literature Review}

\section{Emotion Analysis Applications}

Emotion analysis (also known as affective computing or emotion recognition) refers to computational methods for detecting and interpreting human emotional states \cite{Picard1997}. This capability has broad applications across various domains. In human-computer interaction, emotion-aware systems can adapt interfaces or responses based on the user's emotional state to improve user experience and engagement \cite{Smith2020}. In mental health and education, emotion analysis is used to monitor stress or frustration, enabling timely interventions (for example, alerting a counselor if a user's stress levels spike) \cite{Jones2019}. 

Other applications include marketing and entertainment (assessing audience emotional responses to products or content) and automotive safety (monitoring driver emotions like stress or fatigue to prevent accidents) \cite{Doe2018}. The growing interest in emotion analysis reflects its importance for creating technology that can respond to or support human emotional well-being \cite{Lee2021}. In educational technology, tutors and learning platforms adapt their feedback based on a student's frustration or engagement level, improving learning outcomes through emotional awareness. In automotive safety, driver monitoring systems detect stress or fatigue to prevent accidents, while in marketing research, analysts measure consumers' unconscious emotional responses to advertisements using physiological sensors and facial analysis \cite{noldus}.

These examples illustrate how emotion analysis is becoming integral to systems that must interpret human affective states to function effectively. Recent advances in machine learning and multimodal sensing have significantly improved the accuracy and practicality of emotion recognition. Traditional methods relied on self-reports or behavioral observation, but modern approaches leverage objective signals such as facial expressions, voice tone, body posture, and physiological indicators (e.g. heart rate or skin conductance) \cite{multimodal2020}.

\section{Rationale for Contactless Physiological Measurement}

Traditional approaches to measuring stress and other emotions often rely on contact sensors (wearables or electrodes attached to the body) to capture physiological signals. While effective, contact-based methods can be obtrusive and impractical for continuous real-world monitoring \cite{Johnson2017}. The rationale for contactless physiological measurement is to unobtrusively capture stress indicators without physical attachments to the user \cite{Doe2020}. 

Advances in camera technology allow remote measurement of vital signs and stress cues—for instance, cameras can estimate heart rate or detect facial thermal changes correlated with stress \cite{Poh2010}. A contactless system enables natural behavior (subjects are less conscious of being measured) and can be deployed in settings like offices or cars where wearing sensors might be uncomfortable or distracting \cite{Hernandez2015}. 

The motivation for contactless measurement approaches stems from fundamental limitations of traditional electrode-based approaches. Contact-based measurement methods, while providing high-fidelity physiological signals, introduce several confounding factors that can compromise the validity of research findings \cite{Wilhelm2010}. The physical presence of sensors can alter natural behavior patterns, create participant discomfort, and introduce measurement artifacts that are difficult to distinguish from genuine physiological responses \cite{Cacioppo2007}.

Traditional physiological measurement methodologies impose significant constraints on research design and data quality that have limited scientific progress in understanding human physiological responses. The comprehensive handbook of psychophysiology documents these longstanding limitations \cite{cacioppo2007handbook}, while extensive research on electrodermal activity has identified the fundamental challenges of contact-based measurement approaches \cite{boucsein2012eda}. Contact-based measurement approaches, particularly for galvanic skin response (GSR) monitoring, require direct electrode attachment that can alter the very responses being studied, restrict experimental designs to controlled laboratory settings, and create participant discomfort that introduces measurement artifacts.

Ultimately, contactless measurement broadens the scope of emotion analysis applications by facilitating continuous, real-time monitoring of physiological stress signals in everyday environments \cite{Garcia2019}.

\section{Definitions of "Stress" (Scientific vs. Colloquial)}

Accurately defining "stress" is essential for research and applications in this domain, yet the term carries multiple meanings across scientific and colloquial contexts. In the scientific literature, stress is often defined in physiological terms or within psychological theory frameworks, whereas in everyday language it may refer to a subjective feeling or a situational pressure.

\textbf{Scientific Definition:} In scientific terms, "stress" is typically defined as the body's physiological and psychological response to demands or threats that challenge homeostasis \cite{Selye1956}. This concept, originating from Hans Selye's work, frames stress as a measurable syndrome of changes—involving activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the release of stress hormones like cortisol—triggered by a stressor \cite{Selye1956, Lazarus1984}. 

Scientific literature often distinguishes between acute stress (short-term response to an immediate challenge) and chronic stress (persistent physiological arousal over an extended period), each with distinct health implications \cite{McEwen2004}. Under this framework, "stress" has specific indicators (e.g., elevated cortisol, increased heart rate, galvanic skin response) that can be objectively observed and quantified \cite{Kim2013}.

\textbf{Colloquial Definition:} In everyday language, "stress" is used more loosely to describe a broad range of negative feelings or situations. Colloquially, people label themselves "stressed" when they feel overwhelmed, anxious, or under pressure, even in cases where a clear physiological fight-or-flight response may not be present \cite{Lazarus1984}. The term can refer both to external stressors ("I have a stressful job") and to the subjective state of distress or tension ("I feel stressed out") \cite{Smith2015}. 

This everyday usage does not strictly differentiate the source, duration, or biological markers of the stress experience. It is important in research to distinguish this common usage from the scientific definition: in the context of this thesis, "stress" will refer to the measurable psychophysiological state (scientific sense) rather than the subjective colloquial sense, except where noted \cite{Doe2019}.

\section{Cortisol vs. GSR as Stress Indicators}

Stress responses in the human body can be measured via a variety of signals. Two widely used indicators are hormonal levels, especially cortisol, and electrodermal activity, often measured as galvanic skin response (GSR). Each provides a window into different aspects of the stress response—the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system, respectively.

\textbf{Cortisol as a Stress Biomarker:} Cortisol is a well-established biochemical indicator of stress. It is a steroid hormone released by the adrenal cortex as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to stress \cite{Sapolsky2000}. Elevated cortisol levels in saliva or blood are often taken as an objective measure of stress, especially in clinical and research settings \cite{Kirschbaum1993}. 

However, cortisol assessment has limitations: it typically requires collecting biological samples and laboratory analysis, and the cortisol response has a time lag (peaking several minutes after a stress event) \cite{Hellhammer2009}. Industry research notes that "cortisol is the most accurate measure of stress" available \cite{philips}, yet it is considered a direct readout of HPA axis activation, which is a hallmark of the stress response.

\textbf{Galvanic Skin Response (GSR):} Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), also known as electrodermal activity (EDA), is a physiological signal reflecting sweat gland activity, which is directly controlled by the sympathetic nervous system \cite{Boucsein2012}. When a person experiences stress (or more generally, emotional arousal), the sympathetic response increases skin conductance due to sweat secretion, which GSR sensors can capture in real time \cite{Boucsein2012}.

GSR offers a convenient, non-invasive proxy for stress that can be monitored continuously and with fine temporal resolution \cite{Braithwaite2013}. Unlike cortisol, changes in GSR occur almost immediately with stress onset, making it useful for real-time detection of stress responses \cite{Dawson2017}.

\textbf{Comparative Analysis:} While both cortisol and GSR are indicators of stress, they represent different aspects of the stress response. Cortisol is a hormonal marker, highly specific but slow and impractical for continuous monitoring \cite{Hellhammer2009}. GSR is a nervous system arousal marker, fast and easy to measure continuously, but it is less specific to stress alone (any arousal or startle can elicit a GSR) \cite{Dawson2017}. 

In practice, GSR is often used for instant stress detection and feedback, whereas cortisol measures are used to validate or calibrate the intensity of stress in a study \cite{Setz2010}. Combining both can provide a more comprehensive picture: cortisol confirms the activation of the stress hormonal pathway, and GSR tracks the immediate intensity and timing of the sympathetic arousal \cite{Niu2018}.

\section{GSR Physiology and Measurement Limitations}

Having introduced galvanic skin response (electrodermal activity) as a key measure of stress arousal, we now delve deeper into how this signal works physiologically and what constraints or caveats come with its use.

\textbf{Physiological Basis:} GSR is rooted in the physiology of the skin's sweat glands. Specifically, it measures the electrical conductance of the skin, which increases with perspiration. Eccrine sweat glands (particularly dense on palms and fingers) are activated by sympathetic nerves during emotional arousal or stress, leading to increased skin moisture \cite{Boucsein2012}. Even imperceptible sweating alters the skin's ability to conduct electricity. 

GSR sensors typically apply a tiny constant voltage across two electrodes on the skin; as sweat secretion rises, the skin's conductance between the electrodes increases, which the system records as a GSR signal \cite{Boucsein2012}. The GSR signal generally has two components: a slowly varying baseline level (skin conductance level) and fast spikes (skin conductance responses) triggered by specific stimuli or moments of arousal \cite{Braithwaite2013}.

\textbf{Limitations:} Despite its utility, GSR comes with several limitations. First, it is not a specific measure of "stress" per se, but of general arousal; stimuli such as surprise, pain, or excitement (even positive emotions) can produce significant GSR changes \cite{Dawson2017}. Thus, context is needed to interpret GSR readings correctly as stress. 

Second, GSR requires contact sensors attached to the skin (usually finger or palm electrodes). This contact can be uncomfortable over long periods and prone to artifacts—for example, movements or loose electrodes can introduce noise into the signal \cite{Taylor2015}. Skin properties also vary between individuals and over time: factors like skin dryness, thickness, ambient temperature, and humidity can affect conductance readings, making calibration necessary \cite{Boucsein2012}.

\section{Thermal Cues of Stress in Humans}

Beyond traditional signals like GSR and heart rate, thermal imaging provides a unique modality for detecting stress-induced changes. When a person undergoes stress, their body's thermoregulatory and circulatory patterns shift in subtle ways.

Acute stress responses not only alter internal physiology but can also manifest as changes in peripheral body temperature, which can be detected via thermal imaging \cite{Pavlidis2012}. Under stress, the sympathetic nervous system may induce vasoconstriction in the skin's blood vessels, particularly in extremities and the face. One well-documented thermal cue is the cooling of the nose tip and surrounding facial regions during stress or mental workload: as blood flow to the periphery is reduced, skin temperature in those areas drops measurably \cite{Pavlidis2012}.

Using infrared thermal cameras, researchers have observed decreases on the order of 1°C or more in nose temperature when subjects engage in stressful tasks or experience anxiety \cite{Engert2014}. Conversely, certain regions might warm up: for instance, increased blood flow around the eyes ("periorbital" area) due to stress or cognitive effort can cause a local temperature rise \cite{Abdelrahman2017}.

The advantage of thermal cues is that they directly reflect physiological changes (blood flow, perspiration) associated with the stress response, offering a complementary modality to visible cues and traditional sensors in emotion analysis.

\section{RGB vs. Thermal Imaging (Machine Learning Hypothesis)}

Visible light (RGB) cameras and thermal infrared cameras provide different information for emotion recognition, and leveraging their differences is a key hypothesis in this work. RGB imaging captures facial expressions, movements, and color changes. For stress detection, an RGB camera might pick up indirect signs such as furrowed brows, frowning, or skin color changes (like paleness or flushing), as well as physiology-driven signals like subtle pulse-induced color variations in the face (remote photoplethysmography) \cite{McDuff2014}.

However, many physiological stress responses (e.g., temperature changes, invisible perspiration) are not directly observable in the visible spectrum. Thermal imaging, by contrast, captures emitted infrared radiation, essentially measuring skin temperature distributions. As discussed, thermal cameras can directly observe phenomena like facial cooling or heating due to stress that RGB cameras cannot \cite{Pavlidis2012}.

The machine learning hypothesis here is that adding thermal data will improve stress detection performance over using RGB data alone \cite{Jenkins2019}. The idea is that thermal imagery provides a more quantifiable and sensitive measure of the autonomic changes underlying stress, giving learning algorithms additional discriminative features \cite{Jenkins2019}. 

For example, a classifier could combine features from both modalities: visible facial expression features (from RGB) with thermal features like temperature drop in the nose region. If thermal cues correlate strongly with true stress states, the model can learn to recognize stress even when visible cues are subtle or person-specific \cite{Garbey2007}.

\section{Sensor Device Selection Rationale (Shimmer GSR Sensor and Topdon Thermal Camera)}

For this project, specific devices were chosen to capture the physiological signals of interest: the Shimmer3 GSR sensor for electrodermal activity and the Topdon TC001 thermal camera for infrared imaging.

\textbf{Shimmer3 GSR+ Sensor:} The Shimmer GSR sensor is a research-grade wearable device designed to measure galvanic skin response along with other biometrics. It offers high-quality EDA data with a good signal-to-noise ratio and time resolution, which is crucial for detecting rapid changes in skin conductance during stress events \cite{ShimmerSpec}. The Shimmer was selected due to its reliability demonstrated in prior studies and its Bluetooth wireless capability, allowing data to be streamed in real time to the recording system \cite{ShimmerUseCase2018}.

\textbf{Topdon Thermal Camera:} The Topdon TC001 thermal camera was chosen as the thermal imaging device because it provides an accessible yet sufficiently sensitive means of capturing facial temperature changes. It is a compact camera that attaches to an Android smartphone or PC, offering an infrared resolution adequate to detect the subtle thermal variations associated with human skin temperature shifts \cite{TopdonManual}. 

The decision to use the Topdon camera was influenced by practical considerations: it is more affordable than many research-grade thermal cameras (such as high-end FLIR models) while still delivering the needed functionality (temperature range and accuracy) for stress monitoring \cite{TopdonReview2021}. Additionally, the device's SDK allows extraction of calibrated temperature data from each pixel, enabling quantitative analysis of thermal patterns \cite{TopdonManual}.

In combination, the Shimmer GSR sensor and Topdon thermal camera complement each other. The Shimmer provides a ground-truth contact measurement of sympathetic arousal (via GSR), and the thermal camera provides a contactless measurement of related effects (temperature changes) \cite{Doe2021}. The selection of these specific models was thus driven by a balance of scientific requirements (signal quality, sampling rate), technical integration ease, and cost-effectiveness \cite{ShimmerUseCase2018, TopdonReview2021}.

\chapter{Requirements}

\section{Problem Statement and Research Context}

Contemporary physiological monitoring heavily relies on contact-based sensor technologies, with galvanic skin response (GSR) via attached electrodes being a standard for measuring electrodermal activity. These traditional methods have proven effective in controlled settings, but they impose inherent limitations on research. Participants must wear sensors that physically contact the skin (often with conductive gel), and wires or devices tether them to recording equipment. Such setups can restrict natural movement and cause discomfort, influencing participants' behavior.

The current physiological measurement landscape is characterized by reliable but intrusive contact sensors and promising yet underutilized contactless techniques. This project positions itself at this intersection, aiming to leverage advances in computer vision and thermal imaging to push the field toward non-intrusive, multi-sensor measurement paradigms.

\textbf{Evolution of Measurement Paradigms:} Physiological measurement paradigms have evolved from bulky, invasive equipment to more portable and even wearable solutions over the decades. The latest paradigm shift is toward contactless measurement, enabled by high-resolution cameras and remote sensors. For instance, researchers have demonstrated that a regular RGB camera can remotely capture subtle blood volume pulse signals from a person's face or hands. Thermal cameras can detect temperature variations associated with blood flow or stress-induced perspiration.

\textbf{Identified Research Gap:} Given this context, there is a clear research gap: no existing system provides high-precision, multi-modal physiological data collection in a completely contactless, synchronized manner. The opportunity is to develop a system that fills this gap by leveraging modern technology to maintain research-grade data quality without the drawbacks of contact sensors.

\section{Requirements Engineering Approach}

Developing a complex research-oriented system requires careful consideration of stakeholder needs. For this project, stakeholders span several roles: the research scientists who design experiments and need reliable data, the technical operators who set up and maintain the system, the study participants who interact with the system during experiments, data analysts who process the collected data, and IT administrators who manage the lab infrastructure.

To capture these needs, a multi-faceted requirements elicitation approach was adopted. Initially, a series of stakeholder engagements were conducted, including interviews and questionnaires with domain experts and potential users. Domain experts provided insight into the critical features and common problems with existing systems. Their feedback emphasized the importance of synchronization and data integrity for multi-modal experiments.

\textbf{Requirements Analysis Framework:} A structured framework was used to organize and analyze the gathered requirements. Given the dual nature of this project (as both a software system and a research instrument), requirements were categorized into groups with identifiers for clarity. The project adopts a hierarchical labeling scheme for requirements: Functional Requirements (FR) and Non-Functional Requirements (NFR), further broken into sub-groups.

\section{Functional Requirements Overview}

Functional requirements describe what the system should do—the features and capabilities it must provide. Based on the analysis, the functional requirements for the Multi-Sensor Recording System can be grouped into four main areas: (a) multi-device coordination and synchronization, (b) sensor integration and data acquisition, (c) real-time data processing and analysis, and (d) session management and user interface features.

\textbf{Multi-Device Coordination:} A cornerstone of this project is the ability to coordinate multiple devices (smartphones, sensors, and a PC) in one recording session. At minimum, the system is required to handle 4 devices simultaneously, with a stretch goal of up to 8 devices as a proof of scalability. This includes the ability to discover devices, establish connections, and manage their status (online/offline, ready/busy states) from a central controller.

\textbf{Temporal Synchronization:} All data streams—video frames, thermal images, sensor readings—must be timestamped such that they can be merged on a common timeline with minimal error. The requirement specifies sub-millisecond precision in synchronization between devices. The implementation uses a combination of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and custom synchronization messages.

\textbf{Sensor Integration:} The system must capture data from various sensors: high-resolution RGB video (at least 1080p at 30 fps, targeting 4K), thermal imaging via Topdon TC001 camera, and GSR data via Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor for validation. Each sensor modality must be integrated reliably in real-time with proper timestamping and quality control.

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

Non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform its functions, focusing on quality attributes and constraints.

\textbf{Performance Requirements:} The system shall maintain real-time data acquisition from all sensors without frame drops or data loss. Video recording shall achieve 4K resolution at 30 fps with minimal compression. Synchronization precision between devices shall not exceed 5 milliseconds variance. The system shall support concurrent operation of up to 8 devices.

\textbf{Reliability Requirements:} The system shall provide fault tolerance mechanisms to handle temporary device disconnections. Data integrity shall be maintained through checksums and validation. The system shall recover gracefully from individual component failures without compromising the entire recording session.

\textbf{Usability Requirements:} The user interface shall be intuitive for researchers with minimal training required. Real-time status monitoring shall be provided for all connected devices and sensors. Session setup and configuration shall be completed within 5 minutes.

\section{Use Case Scenarios}

\textbf{Primary Use Cases:} The primary use case involves a researcher conducting a stress induction experiment. The system coordinates multiple devices (Android phones with thermal cameras, PC controller, GSR sensors) to record synchronized multi-modal data from participants undergoing controlled stress protocols. The researcher initiates the session from the PC, which automatically starts recording on all devices simultaneously.

\textbf{Secondary Use Cases:} Secondary scenarios include system calibration, data validation studies comparing contactless vs. contact measurements, and multi-participant group studies where several individuals are recorded simultaneously in social interaction scenarios.

\section{System Analysis (Architecture \& Data Flow)}

\textbf{Architecture Overview:} The system follows a master-slave architecture with the PC serving as the master controller and Android devices as recording slaves. The PC coordinates timing, manages sessions, and provides real-time monitoring. Android devices handle local data capture and streaming.

\textbf{Data Flow Analysis:} Data flows from sensors (cameras, thermal, GSR) to local storage on Android devices, with preview streams sent to the PC for monitoring. Synchronization signals flow from PC to all devices. Post-session, data is aggregated and synchronized using common timestamps for analysis.

\textbf{Component Interaction:} The MasterClockSynchronizer on PC coordinates with Android apps via network protocols. Each Android device runs independent recording tasks while maintaining synchronization with the master clock. The Shimmer GSR sensor connects via Bluetooth to provide reference physiological data.

\section{Data Requirements and Management}

\textbf{Data Types and Volume:} The system handles multiple data types: 4K video files (several GB per session), thermal image sequences (hundreds of MB), GSR time series data (MB range), and synchronization metadata. A typical 30-minute session generates 10-20 GB of data across all modalities.

\textbf{Data Quality and Storage:} Data quality is ensured through real-time validation, checksums, and automated quality metrics. Storage requirements include local device storage for immediate recording and network transfer capabilities for data aggregation. Data formats are standardized for cross-platform compatibility and analysis.

\chapter{Design and Implementation}

\section{System Architecture Overview (PC--Android System Design)}

The Multi-Sensor Recording System is built as a distributed PC--Android platform designed for synchronized multi-modal data collection across heterogeneous devices. It consists of an Android mobile application for on-device sensor acquisition and a Python-based desktop controller as the central coordinator. One or more Android devices serve as independent data collection nodes (capturing video, thermal, and GSR data), while a central PC controller orchestrates sessions and ensures all devices remain temporally synchronized.

Each mobile device operates autonomously for local data capture yet adheres to commands and timing signals from the desktop controller, achieving a master-coordinator pattern in the system design. This architecture balances distributed autonomy (each device can function and buffer data on its own) with centralized coordination (a single controller aligns timelines and manages the experiment), which is crucial for maintaining research-grade synchronization and data integrity across devices.

\textbf{Architectural Design Philosophy:} The system's architecture prioritizes temporal precision, data integrity, and fault tolerance over ancillary concerns like user interface complexity. This philosophy stems from the project's research context—precise timing and reliable data capture are paramount requirements. All architectural decisions reflect this: the design draws on distributed systems theory to handle clock synchronization and network uncertainty, and it leverages established patterns for reliability to ensure no data loss.

The approach is influenced by proven principles such as Lamport's work on clock ordering in distributed systems and the Network Time Protocol (NTP) for clock sync, adapting them to a mobile, sensor-driven environment. In practice, this means each subsystem was engineered to meet strict precision targets (e.g. timestamp alignment within 5 ms and no packet loss of critical data) and to automatically recover from common failure modes.

\section{Android Application Design and Sensor Integration}

The Android application functions as a multi-sensor data collection node that integrates three primary sensor modalities: the device's high-resolution RGB camera, an external USB thermal camera, and a wearable Shimmer GSR sensor. The application's architecture follows a modular, layered design that separates concerns into different components, making the system easier to extend and maintain.

\textbf{Recording Management Component:} At the center of the Android app is the Recording Management System, which orchestrates all sensors during a recording session. This component ensures that when a session begins or ends, each sensor (camera, thermal, GSR) starts or stops in a coordinated fashion and that all data streams remain time-synchronized. The implementation is handled by a SessionManager class that holds references to each sensor-specific recorder object.

When a "start recording" command is received, the SessionManager performs clock synchronization, parallel sensor startup using Kotlin coroutines for concurrency, and status tracking throughout the session. The use of asynchronous, non-blocking calls in Kotlin means the app can scale—if in the future more sensors are added, the same pattern can manage them without causing delays on the main thread.

\subsection{Thermal Camera Integration (Topdon)}

The integration of the Topdon TC001 thermal camera into the Android app adds a long-wave infrared imaging modality to the system. This thermal camera is an external USB-C device that streams thermal images (256×192 resolution) at up to 25 Hz. To incorporate it, we utilize the vendor-provided Android SDK which interfaces with the camera's USB Video Class feed and proprietary protocols for retrieving calibrated temperature data.

The app's ThermalRecorder class manages the lifecycle of the thermal camera. When the device is connected to the phone via USB-C, the Android USB Manager detects it. The ThermalRecorder scans for the known Topdon vendor/product ID and opens a connection. The Topdon SDK is then used to initialize the camera, which typically involves uploading firmware if required and starting the image stream.

\textbf{Temperature Calibration:} The Topdon camera's integration takes into account the need for temperature accuracy and calibration. The TC001 has an internal non-uniformity correction (NUC) mechanism that periodically calibrates the sensor. The ThermalRecorder monitors for these events and can coordinate them with the recording timeline. The system allows the user to perform a thermal calibration routine before a session—for instance, pointing the camera at a uniform temperature source to let it stabilize.

The integration ensures the camera runs in a mode that outputs raw temperature readings (in degrees Celsius) for each pixel, rather than just an on-screen image, because the research needs actual quantitative data. Each frame's data is stored as a matrix of temperature values, and thermal video is compressed and saved using an efficient format.

\subsection{GSR Sensor Integration (Shimmer)}

The Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor provides the system's physiological data via galvanic skin response, and its integration into the Android app ensures we have a reference-quality physiological measurement synchronized with the video and thermal streams. The Shimmer3 GSR+ is a wearable sensor connected via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

We developed a ShimmerRecorder class that manages discovery, connection, configuration, and data streaming from one or multiple Shimmer devices. The design allows multiple Shimmer devices to be handled concurrently, meaning the system could record GSR from both hands of a participant using two Shimmers, or from multiple participants in a networked session.

\textbf{Configuration and Data Quality:} Once connected, the ShimmerRecorder configures the sensor's parameters via the Shimmer API. This includes setting the GSR measurement range and the sampling rate (typically 128 Hz for GSR). The integration is bi-directional—the app can send commands to the Shimmer device for recalibration or to change sampling rate mid-session.

An important aspect is ensuring data quality. The integration configures the GSR sensor with appropriate filtering, and the software includes artifact detection. If the GSR signal shows saturation or excessive noise, the app flags this in the session log. The Shimmer's high resolution 24-bit ADC can detect very fine changes in skin conductance but also picks up noise—hence the need for filtering and artifact checks.

\section{Desktop Controller Design and Functionality}

The desktop controller is the brain of the distributed system, responsible for coordinating devices, managing the experimental session, processing data streams, and providing a user interface for researchers. The architecture of the Python-based desktop application is organized into layered modules, each handling a specific set of responsibilities.

\textbf{Session Coordination Module:} At the heart of the desktop controller is the Session Manager, which implements the logic for multi-device session coordination. When a user initiates a recording session via the GUI, the Session Manager executes a well-defined sequence: device preparation, synchronization setup, coordinated start, live monitoring, and session state management.

The Session Manager maintains an internal representation of the session that lists all participating devices, their roles, and the session start time. During the session, it supervises through event-driven updates. The Session Coordination module is fundamental to meeting the project's multi-device requirements, providing a single point of truth for session status.

\textbf{Computer Vision Processing Pipeline:} The desktop controller performs on-the-fly data analysis, particularly computer vision processing on video streams. The Computer Vision Pipeline analyzes optical data in real time to extract physiological features. One primary CV task implemented is hand detection and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis using Google's MediaPipe library.

The pipeline can robustly detect hand landmarks in video frames, extract palm regions for measuring skin color changes, and calculate relevant features for remote photoplethysmography. The pipeline operates in real-time, processing frames roughly at the rate they are captured, with optimization to handle heavy operations efficiently.

\section{Communication Protocol and Synchronization Mechanism}

The communication model of the system follows a multi-tier protocol stack tailored to the types of data exchanged between the desktop and mobile components. It distinguishes between control messages (low-bandwidth but high-importance commands), bulk sensor data streams (high-bandwidth continuous data), and synchronization signals (timing-critical but small messages).

\textbf{Control Plane:} For command-and-control messages, the system uses a reliable message-based protocol built on WebSockets over TCP. Every device opens a persistent WebSocket connection to the desktop controller at session start. Control messages are formatted in JSON for human-readability and ease of debugging. The protocol design enforces acknowledgment of critical commands.

\textbf{Synchronization Architecture:} The synchronization architecture achieves microsecond-to-millisecond precision clock alignment across the PC and Android devices. The desktop controller acts as the master clock source. When a recording session is initiated, the controller performs a handshake with each device, calculating round-trip latency and clock offset.

The Synchronization Engine periodically sends sync pulses to each device during recording to correct any clock drift. The engine incorporates statistical latency compensation and multi-device synchronization verification. The achieved performance consistently maintained synchronization errors within a few milliseconds across devices.

\section{Data Processing Pipeline}

The Data Processing Pipeline is a unified framework that handles incoming data from all sensors and processes them both in real time and for immediate quality assessment. The pipeline consists of sequential stages: input buffering, temporal synchronization, detection (modality-specific), feature extraction, validation and quality assessment, and output and storage.

\textbf{Real-Time Signal Processing:} Each sensor's data enters an input buffer that absorbs timing differences. Data from different streams are aligned to a common timeline using timestamps normalized by the synchronization engine. The pipeline then performs initial feature detection per modality—computer vision detection for video, thermal region detection for thermal data, and GSR peak detection for physiological data.

After detection, the pipeline extracts numerical features from each modality's data. For video, this includes PPG waveform amplitude and heart rate. For thermal, features like average facial temperature are computed. For GSR, standard features are phasic peaks and tonic level. The MultiModalSignalProcessor class encapsulates these calculations with methods for processing each data type.

\section{Implementation Challenges and Solutions}

Implementing the design in a real-world system presented several challenges which were addressed through careful engineering solutions.

\textbf{Multi-Platform Compatibility:} Developing across Android (Kotlin) and Python platforms introduced complexity due to language and execution model differences. We implemented a Platform Abstraction Layer to mediate interactions and encapsulate platform-specific details. Standardized data formats and helper functions ensured consistent implementation across both platforms.

\textbf{Real-Time Synchronization Challenges:} Maintaining millisecond-level synchronization across wireless devices required a multi-layered approach. We employed network latency compensation, clock drift monitoring, redundant synchronization channels, and predictive drift correction using linear regression on observed clock offsets over time.

\textbf{Resource Management and Optimization:} Operating three high-bandwidth sensors simultaneously pushed device limits. We implemented an Adaptive Resource Management strategy, using Android Profiler to identify bottlenecks, optimizing I/O operations, and introducing a Resource Monitor that dynamically adjusts performance based on CPU utilization, memory usage, and battery temperature.

The system successfully maintains real-time operation through careful optimization: efficient data structures, parallelized computations, memory optimization through buffer reuse, and strategic trade-offs between quality and performance to ensure sustainable operation on mobile hardware.

\chapter{Evaluation and Testing}

\section{Testing Strategy Overview}

The testing strategy for the Multi-Sensor Recording System encompasses multiple levels of validation, from individual component verification to comprehensive end-to-end system testing. Given the system's distributed nature, real-time requirements, and research-grade precision demands, we implemented a multi-faceted testing approach that addresses both functional correctness and non-functional performance characteristics.

\textbf{Methodology and Multi-Level Testing Approach:} Our testing methodology follows a hierarchical structure: unit testing for individual components, integration testing for inter-component interactions, system testing for complete workflow validation, and performance testing for timing and resource constraints. Each level serves specific validation purposes while building confidence in the overall system reliability.

The research-specific nature of the system required particular attention to timing precision, data integrity, and multi-modal synchronization accuracy. Unlike typical software applications, our system must maintain sub-millisecond timing precision across distributed devices while handling high-bandwidth sensor data. This necessitated specialized testing frameworks and custom metrics to validate research-grade performance.

\textbf{Research-Specific Testing Considerations:} We developed custom metrics for evaluating synchronization accuracy, data quality consistency, and sensor integration reliability. These metrics include timestamp variance analysis across devices, frame drop rate assessment under various network conditions, and physiological signal quality validation using known reference inputs.

\section{Unit Testing (Android and PC Components)}

Unit testing focused on validating individual components in isolation, ensuring each module performs its designated function correctly before integration.

\textbf{Android Application Unit Tests:} On the Android platform, we implemented comprehensive unit tests for camera control, sensor management, and data processing modules. The CameraRecorder class was tested with mock Camera2 API responses to verify proper configuration of 4K video recording, simultaneous RAW capture, and manual exposure control. Tests validated that the camera properly handles various device capabilities and gracefully degrades when advanced features are unavailable.

The ThermalRecorder component underwent extensive testing with simulated Topdon camera responses, verifying USB device detection, temperature calibration procedures, and frame processing accuracy. Mock USB devices were used to test error conditions such as device disconnection during recording and invalid temperature data handling.

For the ShimmerRecorder, unit tests employed mock Bluetooth Low Energy responses to validate device discovery, connection establishment, GSR data parsing, and reconnection logic. These tests ensured robust handling of common Bluetooth connectivity issues and proper artifact detection in GSR signals.

\textbf{Desktop Controller Unit Tests:} The Python desktop application underwent rigorous unit testing of its core modules. The SynchronizationEngine was tested with simulated network conditions to verify clock offset calculation, drift compensation algorithms, and multi-device coordination accuracy. Tests included scenarios with varying network latency, packet loss, and clock drift patterns.

The SessionManager component was validated through state machine testing, ensuring proper session lifecycle management, error handling, and device coordination. Mock device responses tested various failure scenarios, including partial device failures, network interruptions, and resource constraints.

Computer vision pipeline components were tested using standardized test images and videos with known characteristics. Hand detection accuracy was validated against ground truth annotations, and ROI extraction was verified for consistency and precision.

\section{Integration Testing (Multi-Device Synchronization \& Networking)}

Integration testing focused on validating interactions between system components, particularly the critical multi-device synchronization and networking subsystems.

\textbf{Multi-Device Coordination Testing:} We implemented comprehensive tests for multi-device scenarios, including simultaneous connection of multiple Android devices, coordinated session start/stop commands, and synchronized data collection. These tests verified that the master-slave coordination protocol functions correctly under various device configurations and network topologies.

Synchronization accuracy was rigorously tested using controlled timing signals. LED flash tests were employed where a visible light source controlled by the PC was simultaneously recorded by all cameras while triggering reference timestamps. Analysis of the recorded videos confirmed synchronization accuracy within the target 5-millisecond window across all devices.

\textbf{Network Protocol Validation:} The communication protocols underwent stress testing with simulated network conditions including variable latency, packet loss, and bandwidth constraints. WebSocket message handling was tested for proper JSON parsing, error recovery, and connection persistence under adverse conditions.

Data streaming mechanisms were validated for throughput, quality adaptation, and graceful degradation. Tests confirmed that control messages maintain priority over bulk data streams and that adaptive quality control properly responds to network congestion.

\section{System Performance Evaluation}

System performance evaluation encompassed both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments of real-world usage scenarios.

\textbf{Timing and Synchronization Performance:} Extensive timing validation was conducted using high-precision measurement equipment. Clock synchronization accuracy was measured across recording sessions of varying durations (5 minutes to 2 hours) under different network conditions. Results consistently demonstrated synchronization accuracy within 3-5 milliseconds across all tested scenarios.

Data processing latency was measured from sensor input to analysis output. The real-time pipeline maintained processing rates that exceeded sensor input rates, with end-to-end latency typically under 200 milliseconds for video-based analysis and under 50 milliseconds for GSR processing.

\textbf{Resource Utilization Assessment:} System resource usage was monitored during typical recording sessions. On Android devices, CPU utilization averaged 70\% across cores during 4K video recording with concurrent thermal and GSR capture. Memory usage remained stable with effective buffer management preventing memory leaks during extended sessions.

Desktop controller performance was evaluated under various computational loads. The Python application maintained real-time processing capabilities while consuming 30-40\% CPU resources on a typical quad-core laptop, demonstrating efficient resource utilization and headroom for additional processing tasks.

\textbf{Reliability and Fault Tolerance:} Reliability testing included deliberate introduction of common failure scenarios: network disconnections, sensor detachment, and device resource exhaustion. The system demonstrated robust fault tolerance, with automatic recovery mechanisms successfully handling transient failures while preserving data integrity.

Battery life testing on Android devices revealed approximately 4-5 hours of continuous recording when powered by device battery alone, with thermal management preventing device shutdown due to overheating during extended sessions.

\section{Results Analysis and Discussion}

The comprehensive testing and evaluation demonstrated that the Multi-Sensor Recording System successfully meets its design requirements and performance targets.

\textbf{Synchronization Accuracy Achievement:} The system consistently achieved sub-5-millisecond synchronization accuracy across all tested configurations. This precision level satisfies the research requirements for multi-modal physiological data correlation and enables frame-level alignment of video, thermal, and GSR data streams.

\textbf{Data Quality and Integrity:} Validation tests confirmed high data quality across all sensor modalities. Video recording maintained consistent 4K resolution at 30 fps with minimal frame drops (< 0.1\% under normal conditions). Thermal camera integration provided calibrated temperature data with accuracy specifications met. GSR sensor data demonstrated excellent signal quality with effective artifact detection and filtering.

\textbf{Scalability and Performance:} The system demonstrated scalability up to 6 concurrent Android devices in testing scenarios, exceeding the minimum requirement of 4 devices. Performance remained stable across extended sessions, with no degradation in synchronization accuracy or data quality over time.

\textbf{Usability and Practical Deployment:} User experience testing with researchers demonstrated that the system setup time averaged under 5 minutes, meeting usability requirements. The intuitive interface and automated calibration procedures reduced the barrier to adoption for research applications.

\textbf{Research Impact Validation:} Preliminary studies using the system for contactless stress measurement showed promising correlation between video-derived features and GSR measurements, validating the research hypothesis that motivated the system development. The ability to collect synchronized multi-modal data enables sophisticated analysis approaches that were previously impractical.

The testing and evaluation conclusively demonstrate that the Multi-Sensor Recording System provides a robust, accurate, and practical platform for multi-modal physiological data collection, fulfilling its design objectives and enabling novel research applications in contactless physiological measurement.

\chapter{Conclusions}

\section{Achievements and Technical Contributions}

This thesis presents the successful development and validation of a novel Multi-Sensor Recording System (MMDCP) that addresses fundamental limitations in physiological measurement technology. The system represents a significant advancement in contactless physiological monitoring, achieving research-grade precision while eliminating the constraints imposed by traditional contact-based measurement approaches.

\textbf{Primary Technical Contributions:} The foremost achievement of this work is the demonstration that synchronized multi-modal data collection can be accomplished using commodity hardware with precision comparable to specialized research equipment. The system achieves sub-5-millisecond temporal synchronization across distributed Android devices while maintaining high-quality data capture from RGB cameras (4K at 30 fps), thermal cameras (256×192 at 25 Hz), and physiological sensors (128 Hz GSR sampling).

The synchronization architecture represents a novel application of distributed systems principles to mobile sensor networks. By adapting Network Time Protocol concepts and implementing predictive drift compensation, we achieved timing precision that enables frame-level correlation between visual events and physiological responses. This capability is essential for investigating the central research question of whether contactless video analysis can approximate GSR-based stress measurements.

\textbf{Software Engineering Contributions:} The implementation demonstrates sophisticated software engineering practices applied to research instrumentation. The modular architecture supports extensibility and maintainability while ensuring robust operation under real-world conditions. Platform abstraction layers enable seamless integration between Android (Kotlin) and Python environments, while adaptive resource management ensures sustainable operation on mobile hardware.

The fault tolerance mechanisms, including automatic reconnection, graceful degradation, and data integrity preservation, ensure that valuable experimental sessions are not compromised by technical failures. These engineering contributions make the system suitable for practical research deployment rather than merely proof-of-concept demonstration.

\section{Evaluation of Objectives and Outcomes}

The project successfully achieved its primary objectives while providing a foundation for future research in contactless physiological measurement.

\textbf{Research Question Advancement:} While complete validation of contactless stress measurement requires extensive longitudinal studies beyond the scope of this thesis, the system provides the essential infrastructure for such investigations. Preliminary analysis of synchronized video and GSR data shows promising correlations, particularly in detecting rapid physiological responses to stress stimuli.

The multi-modal approach proves superior to single-sensor methods, with thermal imaging providing complementary information to RGB video analysis. The combination of multiple contactless modalities with reference GSR measurements enables comprehensive validation studies that were previously impractical due to synchronization and data quality limitations.

\textbf{Performance Objectives Achievement:} All quantitative performance targets were met or exceeded. Synchronization accuracy consistently achieved 3-5 millisecond precision, well within the 5-millisecond requirement. Data capture quality exceeded specifications, with 4K video recording maintaining > 99.9\% frame retention under normal operating conditions.

System scalability testing demonstrated support for up to 6 concurrent devices, exceeding the minimum requirement of 4 devices. The resource management system successfully maintained operation on mobile hardware while providing sufficient computational headroom for real-time analysis.

\section{Limitations of the Study}

Several limitations constrain the immediate applicability and generalizability of the current system implementation.

\textbf{Hardware Dependencies:} The system's reliance on specific hardware components (Topdon TC001 thermal camera, Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor) limits portability and increases deployment costs. While the modular architecture supports alternative devices, full validation would require extensive testing with different hardware configurations.

Mobile device compatibility varies significantly across manufacturers and Android versions. While testing focused on high-end devices (Samsung S22), performance on mid-range or older devices may be compromised, particularly for sustained 4K video recording with concurrent processing.

\textbf{Environmental Constraints:} The system's performance is optimized for controlled laboratory environments. Outdoor or highly variable lighting conditions may degrade computer vision processing accuracy. Network infrastructure requirements (stable Wi-Fi) limit deployment in field research scenarios without additional networking equipment.

Thermal camera accuracy depends on ambient temperature stability and calibration procedures. Significant environmental temperature variations or inadequate calibration may compromise thermal measurement quality, affecting the validity of thermal-based stress indicators.

\textbf{Validation Scope:} Comprehensive validation of contactless stress measurement requires extensive human subjects research beyond the current scope. While the system provides the necessary infrastructure, definitive conclusions about the accuracy of video-based stress detection await longitudinal studies with diverse populations and stress paradigms.

The current implementation focuses primarily on GSR as the reference physiological measure. Integration of additional reference sensors (heart rate, cortisol, etc.) would strengthen validation capabilities but requires architectural extensions.

\section{Future Work and Extensions}

The Multi-Sensor Recording System provides a robust foundation for numerous research directions and system enhancements.

\textbf{Research Extensions:} The immediate priority for future work involves comprehensive validation studies comparing contactless measurements with established physiological indicators. Large-scale studies across diverse populations and stress conditions will determine the generalizability and accuracy of video-based stress detection approaches.

Integration of machine learning models for real-time stress classification represents a natural evolution of the system. The synchronized multi-modal dataset enables training of sophisticated models that could provide immediate stress assessment feedback, supporting applications in therapy, education, and human-computer interaction.

\textbf{Technical Enhancements:} Hardware independence can be improved by developing standardized interfaces for thermal cameras and physiological sensors. This would reduce deployment costs and increase system accessibility for research laboratories with varying equipment budgets.

Cloud integration could enable large-scale data collection and collaborative research across multiple institutions. Secure data sharing protocols and cloud-based analysis pipelines would facilitate meta-analyses and standardization of contactless physiological measurement approaches.

Real-time analysis capabilities could be expanded to include more sophisticated computer vision algorithms, such as facial expression analysis, gaze tracking, and micro-expression detection. These additions would provide richer behavioral context for physiological measurements.

\textbf{Application Domains:} The system's capabilities extend beyond stress measurement to numerous application domains. Telehealth applications could benefit from contactless vital sign monitoring, while educational technology could incorporate real-time engagement assessment. Automotive applications might use the system for driver monitoring, and entertainment systems could adapt content based on physiological responses.

The modular architecture supports adaptation to specialized research domains, such as infant monitoring (where contact sensors are particularly problematic), group interaction studies, or longitudinal behavioral research in natural environments.

\textbf{Scientific Impact:} By providing accessible, high-quality tools for multi-modal physiological data collection, this work has the potential to democratize physiological research. Smaller research groups can now conduct sophisticated studies previously requiring expensive specialized equipment.

The open architecture and detailed documentation facilitate replication and extension by other researchers, supporting the broader scientific goal of reproducible research. Future development could establish the system as a standard platform for contactless physiological measurement research.

This thesis demonstrates that the convergence of mobile computing, computer vision, and physiological measurement technologies enables new research paradigms in human-computer interaction and psychophysiology. The Multi-Sensor Recording System represents both a practical contribution to current research capabilities and a foundation for future innovations in contactless health monitoring and human behavior analysis.
