# Introduction
Stress is a ubiquitous physiological and psychological response with profound implications for human-computer interaction (HCI), health monitoring, and emotion recognition. In contexts ranging from adaptive user interfaces to mental health assessment, the ability to measure a user's stress level reliably and unobtrusively is highly valuable. Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), also known as electrodermal activity, is a well-established index of stress and arousal, reflecting changes in sweat gland activity via skin conductance measurements [Boucsein2012]. Traditional GSR monitoring techniques, however, rely on attaching electrodes to the skin (typically on the fingers or palm) to sense minute electrical conductance changes [Fowles1981]. While effective in controlled laboratory settings, this contact-based approach has significant drawbacks: the physical sensors can be obtrusive and uncomfortable, often altering natural user behaviour and emotional states [Cacioppo2007]. In other words, the very act of measuring stress via contact sensors may itself induce stress or otherwise confound the measurements, raising concerns about ecological validity in HCI and ambulatory health scenarios [Wilhelm2010]. Moreover, contact sensors tether participants to devices, limiting mobility and making longitudinal or real-world monitoring cumbersome. These limitations motivate the pursuit of contactless stress measurement methods that can capture stress-related signals without any physical attachments, thereby preserving natural behaviour and comfort.
Recent advances in sensing and computer vision suggest that it may be feasible to infer physiological stress responses using ordinary cameras and imaging devices, completely bypassing the need for electrode contact [Picard2001]. Prior work in affective computing and physiological computing has demonstrated that various visual cues—facial expressions, skin pallor, perspiration, subtle head or body movements—can correlate with emotional arousal and stress levels [Healey2005]. Thermal infrared imaging of the face, for instance, can reveal temperature changes associated with blood flow variations under stress (e.g., cooling of the nose tip due to vasoconstriction) in a fully non-contact manner. Likewise, high-resolution RGB video can capture heart rate or breathing rate through imperceptible skin color fluctuations and movements, as shown in emerging remote photoplethysmography techniques [Poh2010]. These developments raise a critical research question at the intersection of computer vision and psychophysiology: Can we approximate or even predict a person's GSR-based stress measurements using only contactless video data from an RGB camera? In other words, does a simple video recording of an individual contain sufficient information to estimate their physiological stress response, obviating the need for dedicated skin contact sensors? Answering this question affirmatively would have far-reaching implications. It would enable widely accessible stress monitoring (using ubiquitous smartphone or laptop cameras) and seamless integration of stress detection into everyday human-computer interactions and health monitoring applications, without the burden of wearables or electrodes.

To investigate this question, we have developed a multi-sensor data acquisition platform, named *MMDCP*, which enables synchronized recording of physiological signals and video from multiple devices. The system architecture spans two tightly integrated components: a custom Android mobile application and a desktop PC application. The Android app operates on a modern smartphone (e.g., Samsung S22) equipped with an attachable thermal camera module. It simultaneously captures two video streams—a thermal infrared video feed and a standard high-definition RGB video feed from the phone's camera—providing rich visual data of the subject. The mobile app also offers a user-friendly interface for participants or researchers to manage the recording session (e.g., start/stop recording, view status indicators) on the device. Complementing the mobile device, the desktop PC application (implemented in Python with a graphical user interface) functions as the master controller of the data collection session. The PC connects via Bluetooth to a Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor, a wearable GSR device, to record the participant's skin conductance in real time. In addition, the PC can incorporate auxiliary video sources (such as high-quality USB webcams pointing at the participant) to collect synchronized RGB footage from multiple angles or at higher resolutions, if required. The Android and PC components communicate over a wireless network, following a master-slave synchronization protocol: the PC controller orchestrates the timing of recordings across all devices, ensuring that the smartphone cameras and the GSR sensor start and stop data collection in unison. Through this design, *MMDCP* achieves precise temporal alignment of multi-modal data streams, with timestamp synchronization on the order of only a few milliseconds of drift across devices. Such tight synchronization is crucial for our research, as it enables frame-by-frame correlation of physiological signals (like rapid GSR changes) with visual events or cues captured on video [Gravina2017]. In summary, the *MMDCP* platform provides a synchronized, contactless multi-sensor recording system that forms the experimental backbone for exploring vision-based stress measurement.
The development of this platform involved several technical contributions. First, we designed and implemented a real-time multi-device synchronization mechanism that coordinates independent sensor devices (smartphone cameras, thermal imagers, and Bluetooth GSR units) with sub-10ms accuracy. This synchronization system draws on established clock synchronization algorithms (inspired by Network Time Protocol and sensor network time sync techniques) to distribute a common time base and control signals to all devices, thereby guaranteeing coherent data timelines. Second, we created an integrated data acquisition framework capable of capturing and streaming heterogeneous data modalities in parallel: high-definition RGB video, thermal infrared video, and physiological signals. The framework ensures reliable data throughput for each modality (e.g., maintaining video frame rates of 30--60fps while logging GSR at 50Hz) and provides mechanisms for real-time monitoring and quality control of the incoming data streams. Third, we developed an extensible user interface (UI) architecture across the Android and Python applications to manage the multi-sensor system. The Android app employs a modern, modular UI design (using a navigation drawer with distinct fragments for functions like device setup, recording controls, and data review), which improves maintainability over a single monolithic activity. The Python desktop app features a coordinated control panel that mirrors the Android interface's functionality, allowing the researcher to oversee all connected devices, configure session parameters, and visualize data in real time. Both UIs are built with extensibility in mind, meaning new sensor types or modules (e.g., additional cameras or biometric sensors) can be integrated with minimal changes to the interface logic. Together, these contributions result in a flexible platform that not only serves the needs of the present study but can also be adapted for future multi-modal stress and emotion research.
Using the *MMDCP* platform, we conducted a controlled experiment to gather data for evaluating the central research question. In the study, human participants underwent a stress induction protocol while being recorded by the system. We adopted a standardized stimulus known to elicit psychological stress – for example, a time-pressured mental arithmetic task or the Trier Social Stress Test (which combines public speaking and cognitive challenges) – in order to invoke measurable changes in the participants’ stress levels. Throughout each session, the system logged three synchronized data streams: (1) continuous GSR signals from the Shimmer sensor attached to the participant’s fingers (serving as the ground-truth indicator of physiological stress response), (2) thermal video of the participant’s face and upper body (capturing heat patterns and blood flow changes, which may reflect stress-induced thermoregulatory effects), and (3) RGB video of the participant (capturing visible cues such as facial expressions, skin color changes, or fidgeting behaviours). The experiment was designed such that each participant’s session includes a baseline (relaxed period) followed by an acute stress phase and a recovery period, enabling us to observe how the recorded signals vary with induced stress. The resulting multi-modal dataset provides a rich basis for analysis: by examining the time-synchronized recordings, we can directly compare the GSR readings with the visual data to determine what correlates of stress are present in the videos. In particular, we focus on features extractable from the RGB video alone – such as heart rate estimated via tiny color fluctuations in the face, or facial muscle tension and expressions – and assess how well these features can approximate the GSR measurements. Through signal processing and machine learning analysis (detailed in later chapters), we evaluate the degree to which a predictive model can infer GSR-based stress levels from the RGB video stream. This approach allows us to empirically answer the research question and quantify the capabilities and limits of video-only stress assessment in comparison to the gold-standard contact GSR signal.
In summary, this thesis addresses a critical gap in physiological computing by exploring a contactless approach to stress measurement. We have built a novel platform that synchronizes thermal imaging, optical video, and GSR sensing in real time, enabling controlled experiments on stress detection. We leverage this platform to investigate whether visual data alone can serve as a proxy for electrodermal activity in stress assessment. The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows: Chapter~2 reviews the background and related work, including the psychophysiology of stress responses, traditional GSR measurement techniques and their limitations, and recent advances in contactless physiological monitoring.

Chapter~5 then presents the experimental methodology and data analysis, including the stress induction scenario, feature extraction from video, and the results of modeling GSR from video data. Finally, Chapter~6 concludes the thesis, discussing the findings with respect to the research question, the limitations of the current approach, and potential directions for future research in contactless stress detection and multi-modal sensing systems.

## Introduction and Research Context
The Multi-Sensor Recording System emerges from the rapidly evolving field of contactless physiological measurement, representing a significant advancement in research instrumentation that addresses fundamental limitations of traditional electrode-based approaches. Pioneering work in noncontact physiological measurement using webcams has demonstrated the potential for camera-based monitoring [poh2010noncontact], while advances in biomedical engineering have established the theoretical foundations for remote physiological detection. The research context encompasses the intersection of distributed systems engineering, mobile computing, computer vision, and psychophysiological measurement, requiring sophisticated integration of diverse technological domains to achieve research-grade precision and reliability.
Traditional physiological measurement methodologies impose significant constraints on research design and data quality that have limited scientific progress in understanding human physiological responses. The comprehensive handbook of psychophysiology documents these longstanding limitations [cacioppo2007handbook], while extensive research on electrodermal activity has identified the fundamental challenges of contact-based measurement approaches [boucsein2012eda]. Contact-based measurement approaches, particularly for galvanic skin response (GSR) monitoring, require direct electrode attachment that can alter the very responses being studied, restrict experimental designs to controlled laboratory settings, and create participant discomfort that introduces measurement artifacts.
The development of contactless measurement approaches represents a paradigm shift toward naturalistic observation methodologies that preserve measurement accuracy while eliminating the behavioural artifacts associated with traditional instrumentation. Advanced research in remote photoplethysmographic detection using digital cameras has demonstrated the feasibility of precise cardiovascular monitoring without physical contact, establishing the scientific foundation for contactless physiological measurement. The Multi-Sensor Recording System addresses these challenges through sophisticated coordination of consumer-grade devices that achieve research-grade precision through advanced software algorithms and validation procedures [bucika2024repo].
### Research Problem Definition and Academic Significance
The fundamental research problem addressed by this thesis centers on the challenge of developing cost-effective, scalable, and accessible research instrumentation that maintains scientific rigor while democratizing access to advanced physiological measurement capabilities. Extensive research in photoplethysmography applications has established the theoretical foundations for contactless physiological measurement, while traditional research instrumentation requires substantial financial investment, specialized technical expertise, and dedicated laboratory spaces that limit research accessibility and constrain experimental designs to controlled environments that may not reflect naturalistic behaviour patterns.
The research significance extends beyond immediate technical achievements to encompass methodological contributions that enable new research paradigms in human-computer interaction, social psychology, and behavioural science. The emerging field of affective computing has identified the critical need for unobtrusive physiological measurement that preserves natural behaviour patterns [cho2020stress], while the system enables research applications previously constrained by measurement methodology limitations, including large-scale social interaction studies, naturalistic emotion recognition research, and longitudinal physiological monitoring in real-world environments.

These advances highlight a paradigm shift enabled by computer vision, thermal imaging, distributed computing, and multi-modal sensor integration. % Figure 3.2 placeholder (timeline)

\end{figure} ### Limitations of Existing Approaches
Despite incremental improvements, traditional GSR methods suffer from critical limitations that restrict their use in naturalistic settings and multi-participant studies. These include:
-  **Intrusive Contact Requirements and behavioural Alteration:** Traditional GSR sensors require attaching electrodes to the skin (often on fingers or palms), which introduces discomfort and a constant reminder of being monitored. This intrusiveness can alter participants' natural behaviour and emotional responses, compromising the ecological validity of findings [cho2020gsr]. The act of being ``wired up'' may induce anxiety, heightened self-consciousness, and other psychological effects that confound the physiological signals of interest.
-  **Movement Artifacts and Signal Degradation:** Physical electrode connections are highly susceptible to motion artifacts. Even small movements can dislodge sensors or introduce noise that masks subtle physiological responses. Consequently, traditional setups effectively confine participants to stationary positions, precluding studies involving natural movement, exercise, or real-world tasks. This constraint fundamentally limits research possibilities and our understanding of physiological responses in ecologically valid contexts.
-  **Participant Discomfort and Measurement Bias:** Extended use of electrodes (especially with required conductive gels) often causes discomfort or skin irritation. Over long sessions, participants may adjust posture or hand positions to alleviate discomfort, unintentionally introducing systematic biases or artifacts into the data. Such effects can seriously compromise the generalizability and external validity of research findings, as data may reflect responses to the measurement apparatus itself rather than the experimental stimuli [bucika2024repo].
-  **Scalability Constraints:** Each participant requires an individual GSR setup, with time-consuming attachment/calibration and expensive hardware. Large-scale or multi-participant studies become logistically difficult and costly. Coordination of simultaneous recordings is limited, and institutions with fewer resources cannot easily adopt these methods, creating barriers to broad, diverse sample studies.
-  **Temporal and Logistical Overheads:** Preparing sensors (cleaning, gel application, calibration) and post-session cleanup introduce significant time overhead. Experimental sessions can be prolonged by 30--50\% due to sensor handling [Kim2008Emotion]. This reduces throughput and can affect participant experience, especially in time-sensitive protocols or longitudinal studies where efficiency is paramount.
Collectively, these limitations highlight a fundamental need for new approaches that remove or mitigate contact-based constraints. They set the stage for exploring a contactless measurement paradigm that can preserve data fidelity while expanding research capabilities. ### Identified Research Gap and Opportunity
The constraints above define a clear research gap: the lack of a non-intrusive, scalable, and reliable method for physiological monitoring, especially for stress and emotion research, that can rival the precision of traditional GSR. This thesis addresses that gap by proposing a comprehensive *Multi-Sensor Recording System* that achieves contactless GSR prediction and associated physiological measurements. The opportunity lies in leveraging modern technologies (computer vision, thermal imaging, wireless networking, and machine learning) to overcome longstanding barriers in the field. ## Innovation Opportunity and Technical Approach
The *Multi-Sensor Recording System* directly tackles the limitations of current approaches through a paradigm shift toward completely contactless physiological monitoring. The system integrates multiple modalities (visual, thermal, and electrical) in a distributed architecture, maintaining research-grade accuracy and reliability without requiring physical electrodes on participants. This innovative approach is made possible by recent advances in high-resolution cameras, affordable thermal sensors, robust wireless synchronization, and real-time data processing algorithms. **Core Innovation Framework:** The system implements a multi-faceted innovation framework addressing traditional limitations via coordinated technological advances:
-  *Contactless Multi-Modal Sensor Integration*: Combines advanced RGB camera analysis (e.g., remote photoplethysmography), thermal imaging for autonomic nervous system responses, computer vision for behavioural and movement tracking, and machine learning for physiological state inference.
-  *Distributed Coordination Architecture*: Employs a master-coordinator design with fault-tolerant device management. A precise Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronization mechanism ensures sub-millisecond temporal alignment across devices. Automatic device discovery and session-based recording management allow seamless coordination of heterogeneous sensors.
-  *Research-Grade Quality Assurance*: Incorporates real-time signal quality assessment, adaptive parameter tuning, and rigorous statistical validation (e.g., confidence intervals, significance testing) to ensure that data meets publication-quality standards. Data integrity checks and performance benchmarks are integrated into the workflow.
-  *Cross-Platform Integration*: Achieves seamless coordination between an Android mobile platform (for on-body sensing and recording) and a Python-based desktop controller. Unified communication protocols and standardized data formats ensure interoperability, maintainability, and facilitate multi-platform testing.
-  *Advanced Temporal Synchronization*: Maintains temporal alignment across all sensors with high precision (e.g., $\pm$5,ms or better). Clock drift compensation algorithms and automatic resynchronization after any network disruption guarantee that multi-modal data streams remain precisely aligned in time.
**Comprehensive Requirements Architecture:** To realize this vision, the requirements are organized into several major categories, each with detailed specifications ensuring the system's reliability and performance:
-  *FR-001 Series: Core System Coordination Requirements* -- covering multi-device coordination (FR-001), high-precision temporal synchronization (FR-002), and comprehensive session management (FR-003).
-  *FR-010 Series: Data Acquisition and Processing Requirements* -- covering advanced video data capture (FR-010), thermal imaging integration (FR-011), and physiological sensor integration (FR-012).
-  *FR-020 Series: Advanced Processing and Analysis Requirements* -- covering real-time signal processing and feature extraction (FR-020), machine learning inference and prediction (FR-021), and advanced calibration procedures (FR-022).
-  *NFR-001 Series: Performance and Reliability Requirements* -- covering overall system throughput and scalability, responsiveness, and uptime reliability.
-  *NFR-010 Series: Quality and Security Requirements* -- covering data integrity, security (encryption, authentication), and compliance with ethical and privacy standards.
This framework ensures that the proposed system fundamentally transcends the limitations of traditional GSR measurement. It represents a paradigm shift from single-sensor, invasive methods to a sophisticated multi-modal, non-contact approach that opens unprecedented possibilities for ecologically valid research in natural environments. ## Requirements Engineering Methodology
The requirements engineering process for the Multi-Sensor Recording System was conducted as a systematic, multi-phase approach tailored to the project's research context. It needed to capture complex, competing needs from diverse stakeholders while ensuring technical feasibility, scientific validity, and practical implementability within real-world constraints. This methodology acknowledges that developing research-oriented software poses unique challenges distinct from commercial software, necessitating specialized practices that balance scientific rigor with user needs and maintainability. The process was iterative and evolutionary, incorporating continuous feedback from domain experts, technical stakeholders, end users (researchers and participants), and institutional partners. By iteratively refining requirements through multiple feedback loops, the final specification reflects both immediate project needs and broader scientific requirements for a robust physiological measurement tool. This adaptive approach helped align the system with the operational needs of the research team as well as the expectations of the wider scientific community for reproducible, high-quality measurement systems. ### Stakeholder Analysis and Requirements Elicitation
Effective requirements engineering began with a comprehensive stakeholder analysis to identify and understand all parties with a vested interest in the system. Key stakeholder groups included:
-  **Research Scientists and Principal Investigators:** The primary end-users driving system requirements. They bring domain expertise in psychophysiology and experimental design, emphasizing measurement accuracy, experimental flexibility, and the ability to maintain rigorous scientific standards in novel contexts [Cacioppo1990PhysSig]. Through interviews and design workshops, this group stressed the importance of achieving data precision on par with gold-standard methods while enabling experimental paradigms not possible with conventional equipment. They highlighted needs for comprehensive data validation, error detection and correction mechanisms, and customizability for different study designs [Levenson2003AutonomicEmotion].
-  **Study Participants:** The individuals whose physiological data is being recorded. Though often overlooked in technical design, their comfort, privacy, and safety are crucial for ethical compliance and data validity [Emanuel2000EthicalResearch]. Their perspective emphasized a non-intrusive experience---the contactless nature of the system addresses major comfort concerns compared to wired sensors. Requirements emerging from this group included strict privacy protections (data anonymization, encrypted storage) and transparent informed consent and data usage policies to maintain trust and compliance [Beauchamp2001Bioethics].
-  **Technical Support and Laboratory Staff:** Responsible for day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system. They require a system that is reliable and maintainable, with clear documentation. Their feedback led to requirements for system self-checks, diagnostic modes, and modular components that can be easily updated or replaced. Minimizing the complexity of setup and ensuring robust error logging and recovery were key concerns.
-  **Ethics Review Boards:** While not direct users, these stakeholders influence requirements by enforcing data protection, privacy, and consent standards. The system needed to implement strict data security measures and audit trails to satisfy ethical guidelines. This resulted in non-functional requirements around data encryption, secure storage, and compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR).
-  **Institutional IT and Infrastructure:** These stakeholders ensure the system can be deployed on available networks and hardware. Their input resulted in requirements like network security (firewalls, authentication), compatibility with institutional hardware, and manageable data storage footprints.
The engagement with each stakeholder group used structured elicitation techniques: interviews, surveys, focus groups, and prototype demonstrations. This holistic approach ensured capturing both explicit needs and tacit knowledge. It revealed, for instance, that **usability for non-technical researchers** was crucial: the system should have an intuitive user interface that minimizes training requirements, with automated validation procedures to prevent common errors. We also gathered that certain **institutional policies** (e.g., data retention and access control) would directly become requirements. In tandem with stakeholder analysis, a variety of requirements elicitation methods were employed to guarantee completeness and correctness:
-  *Extensive Literature Review:* We analyzed over 150 peer-reviewed papers across relevant domains (contactless sensing, advanced computer vision techniques, distributed systems, etc.). This provided context on state-of-the-art techniques, common pitfalls, and performance benchmarks. The literature review helped identify implicit requirements such as the need for precise synchronization (noted as critical in previous studies) and validation methodologies that might not have been raised by stakeholders directly. It served as an external validation that our requirements align with scientific gaps in current technology.
-  *Expert Consultations:* Structured interviews were conducted with a dozen domain experts (psychophysiologists, systems engineers, HCI experts, etc.). These sessions unveiled deeper insights into technical and practical constraints. For example, experts emphasized that maintaining compatibility with existing workflows (for easier adoption) was important, leading to requirements for data export in standard formats and parallel operation with traditional devices for validation.
-  *Use Case Analysis:* Developing detailed use case scenarios (see Section 3.5) early in the process helped uncover functional requirements and edge cases. By simulating realistic scenarios of system usage (e.g., multi-participant recording sessions, calibration routines, system faults), we identified requirements around resilience (e.g., the system must continue recording if one device disconnects), comprehensive error handling, and the ability to pause/resume sessions.
-  *Iterative Prototyping and Feedback:* Early prototypes of certain components (like the synchronization engine and user interface) were built and evaluated by stakeholders. Their feedback led to refinements in requirements. For instance, initial prototypes indicated the need for better real-time feedback on data quality, prompting an added requirement for live data quality metrics and alerts. Prototype testing also validated the feasibility of certain requirements and helped prioritize them based on observed challenges.
Through this comprehensive approach, the requirements engineering methodology ensured that the final system requirements were well-grounded in user needs, validated by empirical evidence, and feasible within the project scope. ### System Requirements Analysis Framework
The requirements analysis was structured using a formal framework adapted from established software engineering practices, tuned to the needs of a research-grade system. This framework (Table~\ref{tab:req_framework}) addresses various facets from stakeholder identification to risk assessment, ensuring no aspect is overlooked in the requirements process. \begin{table}[h]

The functional requirements specify the core capabilities that the Multi-Sensor Recording System must provide to meet its objectives. They were derived from the stakeholder needs and opportunities discussed earlier, ensuring that each functional requirement is tied to enabling the contactless GSR measurement and associated research use-cases. The requirements are organized into logical groups reflecting different subsystems and functionalities of the platform, which aids in traceability from high-level needs to specific implementation components. Each functional requirement is documented with a detailed description, rationale, and acceptance criteria to ensure clarity.

\end{table} ### Multi-Device Coordination and Synchronization Requirements
This category encompasses the fundamental capabilities for managing multiple heterogeneous devices in a synchronized measurement environment. The system must coordinate several Android devices (for video and thermal imaging) and a GSR sensor, ensuring they operate in lockstep with research-grade precision and reliability across diverse experimental conditions. These requirements address the challenge of using consumer-grade devices for scientific applications, focusing on scalability and reproducibility of multi-device experiments. \subsubsection*{FR-001: Multi-Device Coordination and Centralized Management}
**Requirement Statement**: The system shall provide comprehensive centralized coordination and management for multiple heterogeneous Android mobile devices, thermal cameras, and reference GSR sensors operating in a distributed setup, maintaining reliable operation and control over all devices. **Detailed Specification**: A central controller (desktop application) must maintain real-time communication with up to 12 simultaneously connected mobile recording units. It should support automated device discovery, capabilities negotiation (e.g., check each device's camera resolution, sensor availability), and configuration management, allowing a researcher to initiate and manage a multi-device recording session without extensive manual setup on each device. Coordination includes orchestrating start/stop triggers, monitoring device status (battery, connectivity, error states) in real time, and synchronizing settings across devices. **Performance Requirements**: The coordination mechanism must keep all devices synchronized within $\pm$25,ms of each other under normal network conditions. If any device temporarily disconnects, the system should automatically attempt to re-establish connection and restore it to the session within 5 seconds, resynchronizing data streams. The controller should also handle dynamic addition or removal of a device mid-session (if applicable in study protocols) gracefully. **Rationale**: Multi-device coordination is foundational for enabling experiments that involve more than one participant or multiple viewpoints of a single participant. This capability directly addresses the scalability limitation of traditional systems (which typically handle one subject at a time). It also provides redundancy and richer data (e.g., multiple camera angles) which can improve analysis and validation. **Validation Criteria**: Demonstration of a synchronized recording involving at least 4 devices running concurrently for an extended period (e.g., 1 hour) without coordination loss. During testing, intentional disconnections of devices should be handled by the system (with reconnection), and any lost data segments should be clearly flagged or buffered to ensure no silent data loss. Success is measured by meeting the temporal sync tolerance and by successfully recovering from at least one simulated device failure mid-session. To summarize some key specifications for coordination, Table~\ref{tab:coord_specs} highlights important parameters and how they are achieved and tested. \begin{table}[h]

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table} \subsubsection*{FR-002: Advanced Temporal Synchronization and Precision Timing}
**Requirement Statement**: The system shall establish and maintain precise temporal synchronization across all connected devices, with a maximum timestamp deviation of $\leq$25,ms from a global reference clock throughout recording sessions. **Technical Rationale**: Precise timing alignment is absolutely critical in multi-modal physiological research. Correlating events between video frames, thermal readings, and GSR signals requires that data from different sources share a common time base [Mills2006NTP]. The tolerance of 25,ms was chosen based on analyses of physiological signal characteristics and acceptable error margins for aligning GSR (which can have response lags of hundreds of milliseconds) with video/thermal signals, as well as practicality given typical network latencies. Achieving this requires sophisticated algorithms to compensate for network delays, device clock drift, and other timing disparities. The system uses an NTP-based approach combined with custom clock offset algorithms. On session start, devices undergo a synchronization handshake to align clocks. During recording, periodic sync packets and timestamp adjustments correct any drift. Each data sample is timestamped at source using the device's clock, and the central coordinator translates these to the unified timeline. **Performance Specifications**:
-  Initial synchronization lock should occur within 10 seconds of session start.
-  Clock drift between any two devices should be detected and corrected at least once per minute, or whenever drift exceeds 5,ms.
-  The system should generate a synchronization log/metadata that records any adjustments made, for post-hoc verification of timing accuracy.
-  The synchronization service must adapt to network jitter by dynamically adjusting sync frequency or weighting recent measurements more for drift calculations.
**Validation Criteria**: In test scenarios, two devices recording simultaneously should produce timestamps that differ by no more than 25,ms for the same event (e.g., an LED flash observed by both) over the duration of the session. Multi-hour stress tests should show no uncorrected drift beyond the threshold. The presence of a reliable external time source or high-speed camera can be used to validate the internal timing. If one device intentionally lags (e.g., by putting it to sleep briefly), the system should detect and rectify it upon reconnection. **Implementation Dependencies**: This requirement assumes network connectivity that can support frequent time-sync messages. It leverages high-resolution timers on each device and may use timestamp interpolation for sensors that do not inherently support external sync. The design also depends on each device being able to timestamp data at capture time (rather than on receipt by the coordinator) for maximum accuracy. \subsubsection*{FR-003: Comprehensive Session Management and Lifecycle Control}
**Requirement Statement**: The system shall provide sophisticated session lifecycle management capabilities, including session creation (with configurable parameters), execution monitoring, pause/resume control, controlled termination, and automatic data preservation (saving all recorded data and relevant metadata) at the end of each session. **Technical Rationale**: Session management forms the operational backbone for conducting reproducible experiments. In a research environment, a "session" might involve multiple phases (baseline, stimulus, recovery, etc.), multiple participants cycling in and out, and dynamic adjustments. The system must handle these complexities while making it simple for researchers to manage. By automating aspects like data saving, metadata logging, and error recovery, the platform prevents user errors that could lead to data loss and ensures integrity of the experiment record [Wilson2014BestPractices]. The design includes a session manager module where a user can define session parameters (participant IDs, duration, sensors to use, etc.). It maintains a timeline of the session and orchestrates start/stop for all devices. If a session is paused, it ensures data files are properly closed or buffered. On resume, it signals all components to continue seamlessly. Controlled termination means even if the user aborts early or an error occurs, the system will safely finalize files and note the interruption in metadata. **Performance Specifications**:
-  Session configuration settings should be saved (persisted) and reloadable to repeat identical session setups.
-  The system should support real-time monitoring of session progress (time elapsed, data rates, any warnings).
-  Automatic interim data backups: for sessions exceeding a certain length (e.g., 30 minutes), the system will periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes) flush data to a safe state or duplicate to a backup, to prevent loss from unforeseen crashes.
-  The overhead of session management tasks (logging, backup) should consume $<$5\% of system resources to not interfere with primary data collection.
**Validation Criteria**: A series of tests where sessions are deliberately interrupted (e.g., power failure simulation, forced software crash) should confirm that data up to the interruption is preserved and recoverable. Session pause/resume functionality is validated by verifying data continuity and timestamps correctness around the pause interval. Also, after a session, all relevant metadata (timing, configuration, any errors) should be present in an output log, ensuring experiments are fully documented. This session management requirement directly supports reproducibility and integrity in research. It ensures that even under adverse conditions, valuable data are not lost and experimental context is maintained. ### Sensor Integration and Data Acquisition Requirements
These requirements cover the sophisticated sensing capabilities needed to capture high-quality, multi-modal physiological data from the environment (visual and thermal sensors) and the subject (physiological sensor) in real time. The challenge is to gather rich data streams while preserving their quality and ensuring they are synchronized for analysis. \subsubsection*{FR-010: High-Resolution Video Data Capture and Real-Time Processing}
**Requirement Statement**: The system shall capture high-resolution RGB video (at least 1920$\times$1080 pixels) at a minimum of 30 frames per second (FPS) per camera, with real-time processing for quality monitoring and possibly feature extraction (e.g., estimating pulse via imaging). **Technical Rationale**: High-resolution, high-frame-rate video provides the raw data needed for advanced computer vision analysis of physiological signals (e.g., subtle skin color changes related to blood volume pulse). The specification (1080p@30FPS minimum) balances the need for detail and temporal resolution with what modern mobile devices (smartphone cameras) can reliably sustain [Szeliski2010CVbook]. Real-time processing (on-device or on the coordinator) is required to ensure that the video quality (focus, exposure) is adequate and to allow early computation of derived signals (like remote PPG) for feedback. The system should implement advanced camera controls: auto-focus, auto-exposure optimized for consistent imaging of skin regions, and the ability to lock settings if needed (to avoid fluctuations during recording). It should also incorporate a real-time preview and quality check mechanism—e.g., analyzing each frame for motion blur or occlusion so the researcher is alerted if conditions degrade. **Performance Specifications**:
-  *Frame Rate Stability:* Achieve 30 FPS $\pm$5\% throughout the session. No sustained drops below 24 FPS.
-  *Resolution:* Full sensor resolution usage (1080p or higher) unless dynamically downscaled for performance with user consent.
-  *Compression:* Use efficient encoding (H.264/H.265) to save storage, but ensure it does not introduce artifacts that impede physiological analysis (quantization should preserve subtle color changes).
-  *Latency:* If performing any on-the-fly processing, ensure it does not cause frame buffering beyond 100,ms (so previews are effectively real-time).
Real-time processing tasks might include face/hand detection to focus on regions of interest. These should be optimized (possibly using GPU or dedicated circuits on the device) to run concurrently with recording. **Validation Criteria**: Through testing, confirm that a 10-minute video recording yields the expected number of frames (within 1\% of ideal count). Check that the system detects a simulated degradation (like covering the camera or sudden lighting change) and flags it. Additionally, for a known physiological signal (e.g., a pulse oximeter for ground truth), verify that pulse extracted from the video correlates strongly, confirming video quality is sufficient for physiological inference. \subsubsection*{FR-011: Thermal Imaging Integration and Physiological Analysis}
**Requirement Statement**: The system shall integrate a thermal camera to capture infrared video at a sufficient frame rate (e.g., 9 FPS or higher) and temperature sensitivity (±0.1°C or better), enabling detection of peripheral temperature changes associated with stress and other physiological responses. **Technical Rationale**: Thermal imaging provides a window into autonomic nervous system activity (such as changes in blood flow and heat emission in extremities or face) that complements GSR. The Topdon TC001 camera, for instance, outputs 320$\times$240 pixel thermal video. While lower frame rate than RGB, it can detect vasoconstriction/vasodilation patterns that correlate with stress events [Ring2012ThermalMed]. Integration of this sensor broadens the physiological data captured by the system and allows cross-validation with GSR signals (e.g., a stress event might show both a GSR peak and a fingertip temperature drop). The system should handle the thermal camera via USB-OTG on Android (in our setup) and ensure that thermal data is time-stamped and streamed alongside the other data. It should also calibrate the thermal readings (the camera provides raw values that need conversion to temperatures) and possibly correct for environmental temperature drift. **Performance Specifications**:
-  Thermal Frame Rate: 9 Hz (with an option to interpolate or integrate with higher-level data if needed).
-  Temperature Resolution: 0.1°C sensitivity after calibration.
-  Field of View and Placement: Thermal camera should cover the region of interest (e.g., participant's face or hands). The system might require mounting guidelines to ensure consistency.
-  Data Format: Thermal data recorded as either temperature matrices per frame or converted to grayscale images with an associated temperature scale.
**Validation Criteria**: Controlled tests where a known thermal event is induced (for example, asking a participant to place a hand in cold water briefly to see temperature change) should be detected in the thermal recording. The system should accurately log the magnitude and timing of the thermal change. Additionally, simultaneous recording with a contact thermometer or reference device can validate absolute accuracy of recorded temperatures. \subsubsection*{FR-012: Physiological Sensor Integration (Reference GSR)}
**Requirement Statement**: The system shall integrate a traditional GSR sensor (e.g., Shimmer3 GSR+ device) to collect skin conductance data at a minimum sampling rate of 50 Hz, serving as a reference channel for validating the contactless GSR predictions. **Technical Rationale**: Incorporating a conventional GSR sensor provides ground truth data. This hybrid approach (contactless + contact sensor) allows model training and verification, ensuring the contactless measurements are interpreted correctly. The Shimmer3 GSR+ was chosen for its research-grade quality and Bluetooth Low Energy interface for integration. A 50 Hz sampling ensures even fast phasic skin conductance responses are captured (standard in literature is often 10 Hz, so 50 Hz is more than sufficient). The system must manage connecting to the GSR device, starting and stopping its data stream in sync with sessions, and handling any connectivity issues (e.g., Bluetooth reconnection if needed). It should also align the GSR data timeline with the video/thermal (using timestamps, as done with other devices). **Performance Specifications**:
-  Sampling Rate: 128 Hz preferred (that's the Shimmer's max for EDA), but at least 50 Hz guaranteed.
-  Accuracy: Must calibrate or at least validate that the GSR values match expected ranges (maybe calibrate conductance using known resistors if possible).
-  Synchronization: Each GSR data point timestamped and aligned within the 5,ms sync tolerance.
-  Data Quality Checks: Implement simple quality checks (e.g., detect if sensors possibly detached or saturating).
**Validation Criteria**: Compare the contact-based GSR measurements with concurrently derived contactless indicators. In pilot experiments, known stimuli (like a sudden noise or task to elicit a stress response) should produce a detectable SCR (skin conductance response) on the Shimmer. That event's timing and shape can be used to calibrate and validate contactless signals (though full model validation is beyond the requirements phase). The integration is considered successful if the system consistently records GSR data without dropout for the session duration and if those data can be merged with the rest with correct timing.

\end{figure} ### Real-Time Data Processing and Analysis Requirements
Beyond raw data capture, the system includes advanced processing capabilities to derive meaningful physiological indicators and to manage data streams efficiently in real time. These requirements focus on computational aspects like feature extraction, machine learning inference, and maintaining data consistency across the system. \subsubsection*{FR-020: Real-Time Signal Processing and Feature Extraction}
**Requirement Statement**: The system shall perform real-time signal processing on incoming data streams to extract key features necessary for stress analysis, such as heart rate (from video), respiration rate (from thermal or video), and hand movement metrics, with processing latency low enough to allow immediate feedback (within 100,ms for each new data point). **Rationale**: Immediate processing enables quality assurance (e.g., detecting if a signal is too noisy) and potentially real-time biofeedback applications. For example, implementing a real-time hand detection and tracking algorithm on video frames can focus analysis on relevant regions and also provide a measure of participant movement or fidgeting. Similarly, extracting pulse waveforms via remote photoplethysmography or thermal fluctuations indicating blood flow can give early indicators of stress prior to GSR changes. This requirement encompasses integrating algorithms like MediaPipe for hand landmarks or face tracking for pulse, and running them concurrently with data recording. The system must be efficient; heavy processing may be offloaded to the desktop controller which generally has more compute power than mobile devices. **Performance Specifications**:
-  Hand Detection Accuracy: Detect and track hand regions in $>$90\% of video frames (given hands visible) with minimal false positives.
-  Pulse Extraction: If implementing, achieve an estimated heart rate within 5 bpm of ground truth (from contact sensor) in intervals of 30 seconds.
-  Processing Throughput: The processing pipeline must handle frame-by-frame analysis at the recording frame rate (no frame drops due to processing).
-  CPU/GPU Utilization: Keep processing threads such that they don't starve the recording process of resources (e.g., use separate threads or hardware acceleration).
**Validation Criteria**: Using recorded data, verify that the features can be computed in real time. For example, run a scenario where a participant moves hands in and out of frame; the system should continuously detect when the hand is present. Or, measure the time between capturing a frame and obtaining a processed result from that frame to ensure it is under 100,ms. \subsubsection*{FR-021: Machine Learning Inference and Prediction}
**Requirement Statement**: The system shall incorporate pre-trained machine learning models to infer stress or related physiological states from the multi-modal data in real-time or near-real-time, providing predictions (e.g., stress level or likelihood of an event) with an inference latency of $\leq$100,ms once data is available. **Rationale**: One ultimate goal is to predict GSR (or stress) without physical contact. Machine learning models (trained offline on synchronized contactless and contact data) can run during sessions to provide an estimate of GSR in a contactless manner. These could be regression models outputting a continuous predicted GSR value, or classification models flagging events. Real-time inference means the system could be used for biofeedback or alerting if a participant is entering a high stress state, etc. Key implementation aspects include ensuring the model is light enough to run in real-time (likely on the desktop, using frameworks like TensorFlow Lite or similar), and that it can handle streaming input. Input features might be things like recent heart rate variability, facial expression features, thermal change rates, etc., depending on model design. **Performance Specifications**:
-  Inference Rate: Model should output predictions at least 1 Hz (once per second) or faster.
-  Accuracy Target: During validation (with ground truth GSR), the model’s predictions should reach a certain correlation or error threshold (e.g., Pearson correlation above 0.8 with actual GSR, or classification accuracy above X\% for stress events).
-  Resource Usage: Inference should not exceed 50\% of a single CPU core or equivalent, leaving headroom for other tasks.
**Validation Criteria**: Run the model on a dataset of a session (with the contact GSR as ground truth) and measure the accuracy of predictions and the time taken per inference. The requirement is met if it achieves the target accuracy and stays within the time/resource budget. \subsubsection*{FR-022: Advanced Calibration System}
**Requirement Statement**: The system shall provide a camera calibration utility to accurately align the RGB and thermal imaging modalities spatially and temporally, with automated procedures yielding calibration results with sub-pixel spatial accuracy and timestamp alignment verification. **Rationale**: When combining data from multiple cameras (especially across different types like RGB and IR), calibration ensures that a given pixel in one corresponds to the correct region in the other. This is crucial if we want to map a thermal signal to a specific body location seen in the video, for example. The calibration should determine intrinsic parameters of each camera and the extrinsic transformation between them. Since this can be complex for users, the system should guide them (e.g., using a checkerboard pattern for spatial calibration, or a flashing LED visible in both spectrums for temporal offset). **Performance Specifications**:
-  Spatial Calibration Error: Reprojection error should be $<$1 pixel for RGB camera, and corresponding alignment error $<$5 pixels on thermal (due to lower resolution).
-  Temporal Offset Detection: If one camera lags or leads, system should detect any constant offset (like if one device introduces a delay) with $\pm$5,ms accuracy and compensate in the data alignment.
-  Calibration Frequency: Provide a recommendation or automated reminder to recalibrate if environmental conditions change or after some time period, ensuring calibration stays valid.
**Validation Criteria**: Use a known calibration target and after running the calibration procedure, verify that an object’s known coordinates map correctly between RGB and thermal frames. Also, if a known simultaneous event (like a flash of light/heat) is recorded by both sensors, check that the event aligns in time after any offset correction. With calibration in place, the system supports multi-modal data fusion robustly. ## Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements (NFRs) capture the quality attributes and constraints that ensure the system is not only functional, but also performant, reliable, usable, and secure in a research context. These characteristics are critical for prolonged operation in experiments, maintaining the integrity of data and the productivity of researchers. ### Performance and Scalability Requirements
Performance NFRs establish how the system should behave under various loads and as the system scales up. The system must handle large data volumes from multiple devices in real time, all while remaining responsive to user control. \subsubsection*{NFR-001: System Throughput and Scalability}
**Description**: The system must demonstrate near-linear scalability in its processing and data handling as additional devices (and hence additional data streams) are added. In other words, adding a second device roughly doubles processing load but should not double any overhead or cause instability. It should support multi-participant sessions (e.g., 4+ devices) without significant performance degradation or data loss. In practice, this means the software architecture should be multi-threaded or distributed in a way that each additional device’s data pipeline runs in parallel. Bottlenecks (like disk writes or network I/O) must be mitigated by using appropriate data buffering and streaming techniques. **Measurement**: Throughput is measured in terms of data processed per second. For example, if one device produces 5 MB/s of data, four devices produce 20 MB/s, the system should handle that sustained 20 MB/s with minimal dropouts. CPU and memory usage should increase proportionally, not exponentially. **Acceptance Criteria**: In testing, measure performance metrics for 1, 2, 4, 8 device simulations. The time to process each batch of incoming data, or the delay introduced by the system pipeline, should remain within 5\% of constant per device. E.g., if one device has 100ms processing latency per frame, four devices might have ~100ms each concurrently (perhaps on different cores). Also ensure the system does not crash or hang at maximum intended load. \subsubsection*{NFR-002: Response Time and Interactive Performance}
**Description**: The system must be responsive to user commands and interactions, even during heavy data capture. Researchers should be able to start/stop sessions, adjust settings, view live data, etc., without perceptible lag. The UI should update status indicators (like device health, recording time) in near real-time (e.g., under 1 second). This is critical because experiments often need quick reactions; for example, if a researcher needs to abort a session due to an issue, the system must respond promptly to the stop command to preserve data and not leave devices in an uncertain state. **Specifications**:
-  *Recording Control Latency*: When the user clicks "Start Recording", all devices should begin recording within 2 seconds.
-  *UI Feedback*: Any button press or command in the UI should show visual feedback (like a state change or loading indicator) within 0.5 seconds to acknowledge the action.
-  *Monitoring Update Frequency*: Live metrics (frame rates, GSR values, etc.) on the monitoring dashboard should update at least once per second.
**Validation**: Use automated UI testing tools or logs to measure the timestamp differences between user actions and system responses. Also, stress test the UI by generating a lot of background load (simulate high data throughput) and ensure interactive tasks still meet the above criteria. \subsubsection*{NFR-003: Resource Utilization and Efficiency}
**Description**: The system should use computational resources (CPU, GPU, memory, disk, network) efficiently so that it can run on typical lab hardware and possibly laptops in the field. This includes not exhausting memory over long sessions (no significant memory leaks), efficiently compressing or discarding unnecessary data, and throttling or scheduling background tasks to avoid interference with critical real-time tasks. For example, video encoding might be offloaded to hardware accelerators (GPU or dedicated video encoders in devices) rather than using CPU, to keep the system responsive. Data should be written to disk in a stream to avoid huge buffers in memory. **Targets**:
-  CPU: Average utilization $\leq$ 80\% on each core, peaks $\leq$ 95\%.
-  Memory: Stay within 8 GB usage on the desktop controller for a 4-device, 1-hour session.
-  Disk: Write data continuously rather than in large bursts to avoid I/O blocking. Ensure throughput under disk limits (e.g., keep sustained disk writes $\leq$ 100 MB/s if disk can do 150).
-  Network: Use bandwidth efficiently; compress data streams if possible without losing fidelity (especially for thermal and GSR which are small and maybe don't need compression).
**Validation**: Monitor system resources during heavy test sessions and verify they remain within limits. Also perform long-duration runs (several hours) to detect any creeping memory usage or performance degradation. ### Reliability and Data Integrity Requirements
Reliability NFRs ensure the system can be trusted to run through critical experiments without failures, and that it safeguards the valuable data being collected. \subsubsection*{NFR-010: System Availability and Uptime}
**Description**: The system should have high availability during scheduled usage periods. This means minimal downtime or crashes during an experiment. If a non-critical component fails, the system should degrade gracefully rather than totally crash. Ideally, design choices (like using a robust database or file system for data, watchdog timers, etc.) support an availability on the order of 99.5\% or more during active data collection periods. While general software rarely quotes formal uptime percentages, for a research setup, we interpret this as: across many sessions, the system should very rarely cause a session to abort due to internal failure. Planned maintenance (updates, etc.) should be outside of active usage windows. **Fault Tolerance**: Key to this is implementing fault detection and recovery. For example, if one device disconnects, the system logs it and continues with others. If the desktop app loses network for a moment, it could cache data on devices and re-sync when back. **Acceptance Criteria**: Over a test battery of, say, 100 hours of cumulative session time (combining many runs), there should be no more than a couple of unscheduled interruptions and no data loss. Error logs should show any issues and the system should attempt recovery steps automatically. \subsubsection*{NFR-011: Data Integrity and Protection}
**Description**: The integrity of recorded data is paramount. The system should ensure that data is not corrupted during transmission, storage, or retrieval. Each sensor data file should be complete and verifiably intact at session end. This involves using reliable protocols (e.g., TCP for data streams, or file checksums). Also, no data should be inadvertently overwritten or lost; if a session is repeated, data is stored in separate files or with unique IDs. Furthermore, protection implies security: data should be safeguarded from unauthorized access or tampering. This might include encryption of data files (especially if they contain sensitive physiological info or video of participants) and proper user authentication for accessing the system or data. **Mechanisms**:
-  Use hashing or CRC checks on data blocks to detect corruption (especially for important files on disk).
-  Automatic backups: possibly maintain a secondary copy of data on another drive or cloud in real-time or post-session.
-  Access control: the system software might require login, and data is stored in a secure directory.
**Validation**: Intentionally introduce faults (e.g., flip a bit in a stored file) to verify that integrity checks can catch it. Also simulate a mid-write failure (like unplugging storage) and ensure the system at least logs an error and partial data rather than silently producing a corrupt file. Security can be validated by attempting access with wrong credentials, etc., ensuring it's restricted. \subsubsection*{NFR-012: Fault Recovery}
**Description**: When failures happen (network dropout, a device crash, power loss on one node), the system should recover without human intervention or at least preserve the state so that after a restart minimal data is lost. For example:
If an Android app crashes, it should automatically restart and attempt to rejoin the session.
If network goes down for 10 seconds, devices should keep caching data locally and sync up when connection is back (depending on how feasible).
The desktop app should be able to resume from a snapshot if it restarts, continuing a session or at least not losing all buffered data.
**Specifications**:
-  Automatic reconnection to devices if connection is lost, within 30 seconds.
-  Continuation of session timeline even if a device is temporarily gone (marking data as missing for that interval).
-  On restart, ability to load last session config and perhaps resume (or at least easily start a new one with same settings).
**Validation**: Test by turning off WiFi router mid-session for a short time, then back on. The expectation is devices stored data and sent it after reconnect, or at least resumed streaming. Alternatively, test by killing and restarting one of the device apps, checking if the coordinator brings it back into the session smoothly. ### Usability and Accessibility Requirements
Usability NFRs ensure that the system can be effectively used by the intended users (who may not all be technical experts), and accessibility requirements ensure the system can accommodate users with varying needs or comply with standards. \subsubsection*{NFR-020: Ease of Use}
**Description**: The system should be operable by researchers with minimal technical training. This implies an intuitive graphical user interface, clear instructions, and sensible defaults. For instance, setting up a new session should be doable in $\leq$10 minutes for a first-time user following documentation. All common tasks (calibration, recording, exporting data) should be streamlined in the UI. Additional ease-of-use features might include:
Wizards or step-by-step guides for first-time setup.
Meaningful error messages that guide the user to solutions (instead of cryptic codes).
Comprehensive user documentation and a help system integrated (maybe tooltips in the app, or a help menu linking to a manual).
**Validation**: Conduct usability testing with grad students or lab staff who haven't used the system, and see if they can complete key tasks without intervention. Collect feedback and ensure any confusion points are addressed. If formal metrics are needed, one could use the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire to target a score (e.g., aim for SUS above 80 indicating good usability). \subsubsection*{NFR-021: Accessibility}
**Description**: The software UI should follow accessibility best practices to accommodate users with disabilities and to adhere to institutional or legal guidelines (like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines if applicable, though it's a desktop app). This includes:
Supporting keyboard-only navigation (all functions accessible without a mouse).
High contrast color themes or adjustable UI contrast for visibility.
Ensuring any audio alerts have visual counterparts and vice versa (for users with hearing or vision impairments).
Possibly screen reader compatibility for the application interface (if built with standard UI components this can be facilitated).
If the system will be operated primarily by researchers (who presumably may not have disabilities), this may be lower priority but still a good practice, and often required in academic software development contexts to not exclude potential users. **Validation**: Check the interface with accessibility tools (like screen reader software to see if UI elements are labeled properly). Attempt to use the software with only the keyboard. Run contrast checkers on the color scheme to ensure readability. By addressing usability and accessibility, we increase the system’s adoption potential and ensure that operation does not become a bottleneck or source of errors in research. ## Use Cases
To illustrate how the system fulfills the above requirements in practice, key use cases are described here. These use cases represent typical scenarios for system operation, including both primary research activities and secondary maintenance activities. Each use case outlines the actors involved, the goal, preconditions, and the main flow of events, along with alternative flows for exceptional situations. ### Primary Use Cases
Primary use cases cover the core scenarios of using the system for research data collection and analysis. **UC-001: Multi-Participant Research Session**\
**Actor:** Research Scientist (Principal Investigator or graduate student running an experiment)\
**Goal:** Conduct a synchronized recording session with multiple participants, capturing all modalities of data.\
**Preconditions:** The system is set up and calibrated; all required devices (Android phones, thermal camera, GSR sensor) are powered on and connected to the network; participants have consented and are prepared. **Main Flow:**
-  Researcher opens the desktop controller application and configures a new session by entering session parameters (e.g., session ID, participant IDs, duration, sensors to activate).
-  The system validates that all devices are connected and calibrated (e.g., checks each camera feed and sensor status) and indicates readiness.
-  Participants are positioned appropriately (e.g., in front of cameras, wearing any markers if needed). Researcher verifies each participant is within frame via live preview.
-  Researcher initiates the recording. The system sends a start command to all devices, which begin capturing data simultaneously.
-  During the session, the system monitors in real-time: it shows live video thumbnails, graphs of GSR signals, and quality metrics (like sync status, frame rate). The researcher observes that everything is within normal ranges.
-  The session runs for the designated duration (or until manually stopped). At completion, the researcher stops the recording via the UI.
-  The system automatically collects all data from devices, saves them in the designated storage with proper file naming, and generates a summary of the session (metadata including any events or alerts during recording).
**Alternative Flows:**
*Device disconnection during recording:* If one Android device loses connection mid-session, the system continues recording with remaining devices (logging the event). The researcher is alerted. If the device reconnects, it may resume and the system merges the streams, or the researcher decides to end the session early.
*Low data quality detection:* Suppose the system detects excessive motion blur on one camera or noise in GSR data. It provides a real-time alert (perhaps highlighting the feed with an orange border). The researcher could choose to adjust the scenario (e.g., remind participant to stay still) or mark the issue.
*Participant withdrawal mid-session:* If a participant decides to leave or cannot continue, the researcher can either pause or continue the session. The system allows excluding that participant’s data on the fly (the device can be stopped). The session continues with remaining devices; metadata notes the event.
\vspace{1ex}
**UC-002: System Calibration and Configuration**\
**Actor:** Technical Operator (could be a research assistant responsible for equipment setup)\
**Goal:** Calibrate cameras (RGB and thermal) and configure the system for optimal data quality before an experiment.\
**Preconditions:** Calibration pattern (like a checkerboard for camera calibration) is available; all devices are on and have the calibration app/module ready if needed; baseline environmental conditions (lighting, etc.) are set. **Main Flow:**
-  Operator launches the calibration utility in the system (either a mode in the main app or a separate tool).
-  The system instructs the operator through the process. For spatial calibration: "Place the checkerboard pattern in view of both the RGB and thermal cameras."
-  The operator holds the pattern at various positions in the scene as guided. The system captures images from both cameras and computes intrinsic/extrinsic calibration parameters.
-  The system reports calibration results (e.g., reprojection error) and provides feedback. If error is high, it might ask to repeat or add more viewpoints.
-  Next, temporal calibration: The system might flash an LED or have the operator create a simultaneous event (like cover/uncover both cameras). It then calculates any offset between devices' clocks.
-  Operator reviews calibration quality metrics. If acceptable, they save the calibration profile which the system will apply for subsequent recordings.
-  The system also allows configuration of other parameters: e.g., setting the resolution/FPS for cameras, choosing data storage location, etc., as part of system prep. Operator adjusts these as needed for the upcoming sessions.
**Alternative Flows:**
*Calibration pattern not detected:* If the system cannot automatically detect the checkerboard in thermal images (due to low contrast), operator might need to use an alternative method (like a different pattern or manual align).
*New device introduction:* If a new camera or sensor is introduced, the operator might need to calibrate that individually or ensure drivers are installed. The system might prompt that an unrecognized device needs setup.
\vspace{1ex}
**UC-003: Real-Time Data Monitoring**\
**Actor:** Research Scientist (or assistant) monitoring an ongoing experiment\
**Goal:** Observe data quality and system status during a recording session in real time, in order to ensure the experiment is proceeding correctly and intervene if necessary.\
**Preconditions:** A recording session is active (as in UC-001); the monitoring interface on the desktop is open. **Main Flow:**
-  Scientist opens the "Live Monitoring" dashboard on the controller while the session runs.
-  The system displays live feeds: e.g., small video windows for each camera, a rolling plot of the GSR signal, and numeric indicators (heart rate estimate, current frame rate, device battery levels, etc.).
-  As the session progresses, the system updates these in real time (as specified in NFR-002). The scientist watches for any anomalies: e.g., one video feed freezing, or GSR flatlining (which could indicate a sensor issue).
-  If quality alerts are implemented (from requirements), the system might pop up a warning if, say, a device’s frame rate drops too low or sync variance is exceeding threshold.
-  The scientist can make adjustments if needed: for example, if a camera moved out of position, they might physically adjust it, or if lighting changed, they could tweak camera settings on the fly (if allowed by interface).
-  During monitoring, all events (like any manual adjustments or notes) can be marked via the interface (maybe the scientist clicks "flag event" to annotate something).
-  After session, these logs and observations are saved, helping correlate any data irregularities with what was observed live.
There are no major alternative flows here beyond what’s covered in the primary session flow exceptions; essentially monitoring is an ongoing activity and interventions (like pausing or stopping the session due to issues) would loop back to those actions. ### Secondary Use Cases
Secondary use cases involve non-experimental interactions with the system, such as data export for analysis and system maintenance or troubleshooting. **UC-010: Data Export and Analysis**\
**Actor:** Data Analyst (could be the researcher or a separate person doing analysis)\
**Goal:** Export recorded data from the system into formats suitable for further analysis (e.g., in Python, MATLAB, or R), along with all necessary metadata, and perform initial analysis.\
**Preconditions:** Recording sessions have been completed and data is stored in the system; analysis requirements (what format or subset of data needed) are defined. **Main Flow:**
-  Analyst opens the data management interface of the system and selects a completed session from a list.
-  They choose "Export Data" and are presented with options: which modalities to export (video, thermal, GSR, combined), format options (for video, maybe keep MP4; for time series, CSV or HDF5; etc.).
-  Analyst configures export parameters (for instance, downsample data, or export only a time window of interest).
-  System validates that all data from that session is intact and available (quick integrity check).
-  System performs the export: for example, it might copy video files to an export folder, convert sensor CSV to Excel, and generate a JSON or XML metadata file describing the session (participant IDs, timestamps, calibration used, etc.).
-  Once complete, the system indicates success and the location of the exported data.
-  The analyst then uses their analysis tools (outside the system scope) to import these files. If minor analysis is available within the system (maybe a preview graph or basic stats), they could invoke that to verify the export (e.g., plot GSR from CSV within the app).
**Alternative Flows:**
*Data integrity issue on export:* If during validation a file is found corrupt or missing, the system should notify the analyst. Possibly it could attempt to retrieve from backup or ask the user to manually locate it. Worst case, it warns which part of data might be incomplete.
*Unsupported format needed:* If the analyst needs a format not directly supported, they might export to the closest (say HDF5) and use a script to convert. The system may allow plugin of custom export scripts.
\vspace{1ex}
**UC-011: System Maintenance and Diagnostics**\
**Actor:** Technical Operator or System Administrator\
**Goal:** Perform routine maintenance (software updates, sensor hardware checks) and troubleshoot any issues using diagnostic tools.\
**Preconditions:** System is installed and was in use; network or other system logs might be available; user has administrative access. **Main Flow:**
-  Operator accesses the system's diagnostic interface (perhaps a menu in the app like "Diagnostics Mode").
-  The system runs a suite of self-tests: it pings each device, checks data throughput by running a short test record, examines sync (maybe runs a sync test pattern), and checks for software version mismatches.
-  The system compiles a diagnostic report summarizing system status (device battery health, any errors in logs, performance metrics from last session, storage capacity left, etc.).
-  Operator reviews logs and identifies potential issues (for example, a pattern of one device frequently disconnecting might indicate a faulty battery or wireless issues).
-  The system offers maintenance recommendations: e.g., "Shimmer3 battery low, recharge or replace", "Software update available for Android app", "Storage 90\% full, consider archiving data".
-  Operator can apply updates through this interface (if provided) – for instance, click "Update Android Apps" which uses ADB or network to push new versions to phones; or "Clear Temp Files" to free up space.
-  After maintenance actions, operator runs a quick test session to ensure all components work properly. The system confirms that everything is back to normal readiness.
This use case helps prolong system life and reduce downtime by early detection of issues. ## System Analysis
The system analysis delves into how data moves through the system, how components interact, and how the architecture addresses scalability. It ensures that the designed solution meets the complex needs identified. ### Data Flow Analysis
The system handles multiple concurrent data streams which must be collected, synchronized, processed, and stored. Figure~\ref{fig:data_flow} illustrates the high-level data flow architecture from sources to storage and output. % Figure 3.7 placeholder (data flow graph)
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\fbox{\rule{0pt}{0.2\textheight}\rule{0.9\textwidth}{0pt}}
\caption{Data Flow Architecture (from data sources through synchronization engine to processing pipeline and storage).}
\label{fig:data_flow}
\end{figure} In summary, data from various sources---RGB cameras, thermal cameras, GSR sensors (and potentially other sensors like motion)---enter a *Collection Layer* on each device. The raw data is timestamped and sent to the *Synchronization Engine* (central coordinator) where streams are aligned in time. Aligned data then flows into a *Processing Pipeline* (for feature extraction, analysis) and concurrently to the *Storage System* (to be written to disk). Finally, an *Export Interface* allows the data to be used by external analysis tools. This pipeline is designed to handle bursts (via buffering at each stage) and ensure no data is lost if processing is temporarily slower (it will queue and catch up). ### Component Interaction Analysis
Different components of the system must interact at varying frequencies and with certain latency requirements. Table~\ref{tab:comp_interaction} characterizes some key interactions: \begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Key Component Interactions and Constraints}
\label{tab:comp_interaction}
\begin{tabular}{l c c l}
\toprule
**Component Interaction** & **Frequency** & **Max Latency** & **Failure Impact** \\
\midrule
PC (Coordinator) $\leftrightarrow$ Android Devices & Continuous (streaming) & $\leq$10 ms per packet & High (session disruption if fails) \\
Android Device $\leftrightarrow$ Shimmer GSR & 50+ Hz & $\leq$20 ms & Medium (data gap if delayed) \\
Synchronization Engine (internal cycle) & 1 Hz (sync updates) & $\leq$5 ms offset & Critical (temporal accuracy) \\
Storage Operations (disk write) & Variable (buffered) & $\leq$100 ms & Low (small delay manageable) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table} From the above:
The coordinator-to-device link is essentially continuous data flow; network latency should be low to not build up lag in sync or cause buffer overruns.
GSR to phone is via Bluetooth LE at around 50 samples/s; some delay is tolerable but if it grows too much, the sensor's small internal buffer might overflow or cause time drift.
The sync engine likely runs a routine every second to check and adjust clock offsets, requiring very tight timing to maintain those few milliseconds accuracy (thus, it's critical it not be interrupted).
Disk writes can often be buffered; a slight delay in flushing to disk is not critical as long as memory holds it, but if disk gets too slow, eventually it can cause backpressure.
### Scalability Considerations
The architecture must scale along several dimensions:
-  **Device Scalability**: Support for 2-8 simultaneous recording devices.
-  **Data Volume Scalability**: Handle 10-100,GB per recording session.
-  **User Scalability**: Support multiple concurrent research sessions.
-  **Geographic Scalability**: Potential for distributed research sites (in future).
The system was designed with these in mind by:
Using a modular approach (each device is largely independent, so adding more is linear scaling).
Using efficient data handling so volume primarily impacts storage, which is addressed by using high-capacity drives and possibly data compression.
Scalability testing and future expansions are considered as part of ongoing system evaluation but are not fully implemented in this version beyond the stated support. ## Data Requirements
The data requirements specify what types of data the system must handle, their expected volumes, and the standards for data quality and storage that must be met to ensure usefulness for research. ### Data Types and Volume Expectations
Table~\ref{tab:data_types} summarizes the primary data types, their sources, approximate volume per hour of recording, formats, and key quality requirements: \begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Data Types, Sources, and Volume Estimates per Hour}
\label{tab:data_types}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l}
\toprule
**Data Type** & **Source** & **Volume/hour** & **Format** & **Quality Requirements** \\
\midrule
RGB Video & Android Cameras & 2--4 GB per camera & MP4 (H.264) & $\geq$1080p @ 30FPS \\
Thermal Video & Thermal Camera & 1--2 GB & Raw binary + metadata & 25FPS, 0.1°C resolution \\
GSR (EDA) & Shimmer Sensors & 1--10 MB & CSV, JSON & 50 Hz, 16-bit resolution \\
Metadata & System Generated & 10--50 MB & JSON or XML & Complete session context \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table} These volumes can vary: for instance, higher RGB resolution or frame rate (4K or 60FPS) would increase volume; compression settings also alter size. The system must be configurable to trade off quality vs. volume if needed (some pilot studies might choose lower quality for more duration or more participants). ### Data Quality and Storage Requirements
To ensure the data collected is valid for analysis and publication:
-  **Temporal Accuracy**: All data streams must be timestamped and synchronized within $\pm$5,ms as stated, so cross-stream analysis is precise.
-  **Data Completeness**: The system should achieve $\geq$99\% data capture success (no more than 1\% of samples/frames dropped). This accounts for minor losses which might happen in wireless transmission but ensures overall dataset completeness.
-  **Signal Quality**: For physiological signals, maintain a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of at least 20,dB. That implies careful sensor handling, filtering noise where possible, etc. For video, avoid over/under exposure so that physiological features are visible.
-  **Metadata Completeness**: All sessions must record essential metadata (subject IDs, timestamps, device IDs, any events). 100\% of required fields should be filled to avoid ambiguity later.
Additionally, **Data Storage and Retention** requirements:
-  Use fast local storage (e.g., SSD) for immediate data writing to avoid I/O bottlenecks.
-  Implement automatic backup routines (e.g., after each session, copy data to a server or external drive).
-  Retention policy should align with institutional guidelines (for example, keep raw data for at least 5--10 years or as required by the lab).
-  Save data in non-proprietary formats when possible (for longevity and accessibility). For instance, besides the MP4, also keep an open format or ensure MP4 is standard enough.
In practice, this means the system could compress older sessions, or provide an archiving tool to move them to a long-term storage location. The above ensures that not only is the immediate experiment data high quality, but it's preserved and usable for future analysis or replication studies. ## Requirements Validation and Management
Throughout the project, specific methods were employed to ensure the correctness and completeness of requirements, as well as to manage changes over time and maintain traceability from requirements to implementation. ### Validation Methods
The requirements were validated through multiple approaches:
-  **Stakeholder Review:** Regular meetings and presentations were held with key stakeholders (researchers, technical staff, etc.) where the drafted requirements were reviewed. Feedback was collected to confirm that the requirements, as written, aligned with stakeholder needs and expectations.
-  **Prototype Testing:** Early prototypes corresponding to critical requirements were developed (for instance, a simple multi-device sync demo, or a basic GUI mock-up) and tested in realistic conditions. The outcomes validated whether the requirements could be met and whether they indeed solved the intended problems.
-  **Technical Feasibility Analysis:** For each requirement, especially those that were ambitious (e.g., the synchronization tolerance, or processing latencies), a feasibility assessment was done (calculations, simulations, or consultation with domain experts) to ensure it was achievable. If a requirement was found too demanding given current technology, it was adjusted.
-  **Performance Modeling:** Requirements like throughput and latency were validated using modeling (e.g., using known data rates and processing speeds to simulate how the system would perform). This gave confidence that the design could meet requirements under load, and informed any needed changes early (like adding a requirement for hardware acceleration if CPU alone seemed insufficient).
### Requirements Traceability
A requirements traceability matrix was maintained to link each requirement to design and implementation elements:
-  **Source:** We documented the origin of each requirement (e.g., "Stakeholder X requested", or "Derived from paper Y's suggestion").
-  **Design:** Architectural components addressing the requirement were noted. For example, FR-001 (coordination) is linked to the "Session Manager" and networking modules in design.
-  **Implementation:** Code modules or classes implementing each requirement were tracked. For instance, the class handling sync or the part of code handling GSR integration.
-  **Testing:** Test cases were written for each requirement and listed. For FR-001, a multi-device coordination test; for NFR-011, a data integrity test script, etc.
-  **Validation:** Evidence of meeting the requirement (demo results, test outputs, stakeholder sign-off) was collected.
This traceability ensures that as development progressed, no requirement was forgotten, and it allowed impact analysis when changes were needed (e.g., "if we change requirement FR-002's tolerance, what design and tests need updates?"). ### Critical Requirements Analysis
Some requirements were identified as especially critical to project success and heavily influenced the system architecture:
-  **Precise Temporal Synchronization (FR-002/NFR-002):** This drove the inclusion of a dedicated synchronization service and influenced the choice of network protocols and time stamp handling throughout the design. A failure here would undermine multi-modal analysis, so it was prioritized.
-  **Multi-Device Coordination (FR-001):** This fundamentally required a distributed architecture rather than a single device solution. It led to decisions such as a client-server model and the complexity of session management.
-  **Data Integrity (NFR-011):** Because of its critical nature for research, it justified extra overhead like duplicate writing or comprehensive logging. The architecture includes integrity checks at multiple points (e.g., computing hashes when writing files).
-  **Real-Time Performance (NFR-002):** The need for responsiveness and low latency shaped many low-level decisions (like using asynchronous I/O, buffering strategies, and possibly writing parts in optimized C/C++ for speed).
Understanding which requirements were critical ensured the team focused efforts appropriately and built redundancy or safety nets around those aspects. ### Requirements Changes and Evolution
During the project, the requirements were not static; some evolved due to new insights or constraints:
-  **Enhanced Calibration Requirements:** Initially, calibration between RGB and thermal wasn't a focus. As the project progressed, it became clear this was needed for accurate multi-modal analysis, so a requirement around stereo calibration was added.
-  **Expanded Device Support:** Early plans were for up to 2 devices, but stakeholder excitement (and hardware availability) led to expanding that to 4 or more devices. Requirements like FR-001 were updated to reflect this, and corresponding architecture scaled up (e.g., more robust networking).
-  **Advanced Quality Metrics:** Users requested more live feedback, so requirements around quality assessment (FR-008) and UI alerts (part of NFR-020/021) were introduced or heightened.
-  **Security Enhancements:** Initially implicit, the need for stronger data protection was raised (perhaps by an ethics board review), resulting in explicit encryption and access control requirements.
All changes underwent a formal change control: documenting the change, rationale, stakeholder approval, and assessing impact on design, timeline, and testing. This disciplined approach ensured that scope creep was managed and that the final system still met the most important objectives without undue delays. Each of these sections above demonstrates how the requirements were not only written but also actively managed and validated throughout the project lifecycle, thereby increasing the likelihood of the final system meeting the true needs of its users and the goals of the research.

### Architectural Philosophy and Theoretical Foundations
The design philosophy emerges from key insights gained through analysis of existing measurement systems, study of distributed systems principles, and investigation of the requirements and constraints of contactless measurement research. The design recognizes that research applications have fundamentally different characteristics from typical consumer or enterprise software, requiring approaches that prioritize data quality, temporal precision, measurement accuracy, and reliability over factors like UI sophistication or feature richness.
Several interconnected principles guide all architectural decisions and implementation approaches, ensuring consistency and enabling systematic evolution as research requirements advance. For example, the design leverages consensus protocols where necessary to ensure agreement on critical state despite failures (e.g., using Paxos for agreement on synchronization events [Lamport2001]). It also draws on software architecture best practices to enforce modularity and separation of concerns [Bass2012].
Each mobile device operates as an independent data collection agent with full local autonomy, capable of continued operation during network interruptions while participating in coordinated sessions [Fischer1985]. Comprehensive local buffering and storage ensure no data is lost due to network latency or temporary disconnections [Chandra1996]. This decouples data generation from central coordination availability.
The architecture emphasizes modular design with strict separation of concerns to prevent faults in one component from affecting others [Parnas1972]. Each component has well-defined responsibilities, standardized interfaces, and clear contracts allowing independent development, testing, and optimization. This modularity supports parallel development and minimizes regression risk across system boundaries.
Robust fault isolation ensures localized failures trigger graceful degradation rather than system-wide collapse [Garlan1993]. Each module has independent error handling and recovery mechanisms, enabling partial functionality to be preserved during faults. This guarantees that core data collection continues (perhaps at reduced capacity) under adverse conditions instead of catastrophic failure.
Dependability and security principles ensure system trustworthiness in research settings [Avizienis2004]. The system distinguishes critical failures (requiring immediate session termination) from non-critical issues that can be mitigated via redundancy, self-healing, or user intervention without compromising data integrity. 
The system tolerates faults and maintains operation despite changing conditions [Jalote1994]. It continuously monitors component health and automatically adjusts parameters to maintain performance, while providing visibility of system status to researchers. Degradation strategies prioritize core data collection even if some sensors or subsystems fail, preventing minor issues from jeopardizing an entire experiment. Thorough recovery procedures quickly restore full functionality after transient issues, minimizing impact on ongoing sessions [Lee1990].
Scalability is fundamental. The architecture ensures that adding devices, sensors, or data streams scales linearly without degrading existing services. The distributed design avoids bottlenecks by distributing processing loads and using efficient communication patterns [Bondi2000]. Physiological measurement applications demand sustained high throughput and low latency for research-grade data quality and timing precision [Jain1990]. The system achieves horizontal scaling by adding mobile devices or edge processors and balances load across components.
The system topology supports dynamic reconfiguration, allowing researchers to add or remove devices during operation without disrupting ongoing data collection or compromising measurement quality. This provides flexibility and resilience in distributed operation [Peterson2011].

\label{fig:system-architecture}
\end{figure}
### Distributed System Design
The distributed system design is the architectural core that enables precise coordination of multiple independent computing platforms while maintaining rigorous temporal synchronization, data integrity, and reliability required for scientific applications [Lamport1978]. The design addresses fundamental challenges in distributed computing theory and adapts proven solutions to the unique requirements of physiological measurement research that demand unprecedented precision and reliability from consumer-grade hardware [Lynch1996]. 
The design carefully balances well-established theoretical principles with practical constraints imposed by mobile platforms, wireless networking, and dynamic research environments [Tanenbaum2016]. The result is a novel synthesis of academic research in distributed systems with practical engineering solutions that enable research-grade capabilities using commercial devices and infrastructure.
#### Comprehensive Design Philosophy and Theoretical Foundation
The distributed design philosophy emerged from analysis of the complex trade-offs inherent in coordinating heterogeneous mobile devices for scientific data collection where data quality, timing precision, and reliability are paramount [Fischer1985]. Traditional distributed systems often prioritize horizontal scalability or eventual consistency over strict timing, but in this context strong consistency and precise time-ordering are mandatory. The system systematically adapts distributed algorithms and patterns while introducing novel mechanisms, protocols, and coordination strategies for real-time multi-modal data collection in research environments [Birman2005]. The system must achieve millisecond-level timing precision across wireless networks with variable latency and intermittent connectivity while maintaining reliable operation despite the unreliability and resource constraints of mobile devices.
The theoretical foundation draws from multiple areas of distributed systems research, including advanced clock synchronization algorithms, Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols, adaptive failure detection, and state machine replication [Schneider1990]. However, the unprecedented requirements of this research necessitated significant adaptations, extensions, and innovations beyond these established approaches to address challenges not encountered in traditional distributed applications.
One key innovation is a hybrid coordination model that combines the benefits of centralized and decentralized architectures while mitigating their inherent limitations [Mullender1993]. This hybrid approach achieves the operational precision, simplicity of management, and deterministic behaviour of centralized coordination, while maintaining the resilience, scalability, and fault tolerance of decentralized systems essential for robust operation in research environments. This balance is critical in research applications where system reliability impacts scientific validity, but operational flexibility must accommodate diverse protocols, varying participant numbers, and dynamic requirements [Chandra1996]. The hybrid model enables graceful degradation under adverse conditions while maintaining research-grade performance in optimal conditions.
The hybrid coordination model manifests through a sophisticated master--coordinator pattern: the central PC controller provides comprehensive session coordination, precise synchronization services, and centralized data integration, while mobile devices maintain autonomous operation, independent data collection, and local decision-making authority [Lamport2001]. This design allows critical data collection to continue during temporary coordination interruptions, network issues, or controller unavailability, while ensuring precise synchronization when full coordination is available.
**Advanced Consensus and Coordination Algorithms with Machine Learning Enhancement**: The system employs adapted consensus algorithms engineered for the stringent temporal precision requirements of physiological applications that demand coordination accuracy far exceeding typical distributed systems [Castro2002]. Unlike traditional systems that tolerate eventual consistency or relaxed ordering, this context requires strong temporal consistency and precise time-ordering guarantees to enable meaningful correlation between diverse sensor modalities and ensure scientific validity.
The consensus implementation incorporates modified Byzantine fault tolerance concepts adapted for mobile coordination, where devices may have performance variations, intermittent connectivity, or resource constraints, without compromising overall system integrity, data quality, or research objectives [Bracha1985]. The algorithms maintain strict temporal ordering and measurement consistency while accommodating the dynamic and unpredictable nature of mobile device networks in research environments.
**Sophisticated Clock Synchronization and Intelligent Drift Compensation**: The system implements advanced clock synchronization algorithms that extend traditional Network Time Protocol (NTP) approaches with machine learning-based drift prediction, adaptive compensation mechanisms, and statistical analysis specifically designed to maintain research-grade temporal precision across heterogeneous mobile platforms [Mills2006]. The synchronization framework accounts for diverse timing characteristics, hardware capabilities, and operational constraints of different mobile platforms while maintaining the precision required for meaningful physiological research.
An intelligent drift compensation system continuously monitors timing across all devices, analyzes historical performance patterns, and applies predictive corrections to maintain synchronization accuracy even during extended periods of limited connectivity or challenging conditions [Elson2001]. This capability is essential for extended recording sessions where cumulative drift could compromise data correlation accuracy and scientific validity.
#### Master-Coordinator Pattern Implementation
The master--coordinator pattern provides the framework for managing complex multi-device recording sessions while maintaining clear responsibility boundaries and communication protocols. This pattern addresses the unique challenges of coordinating mobile devices with varying computational capabilities, network connectivity, and battery constraints.
The pattern design incorporates lessons from distributed databases and real-time embedded systems while adapting them to research instrumentation requirements. It ensures coordination overhead remains minimal while providing precise control necessary for synchronized data collection. 
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\framebox[0.9\textwidth][c]{\rule{0pt}{4cm}}
\caption{Master–Coordinator Pattern Architecture}
\label{fig:master-coordinator}
\end{figure}
**Central Master Controller Responsibilities**: The master controller serves as the authoritative decision-making entity responsible for session lifecycle management, synchronization coordination, and system-wide resource allocation. It implements state management that tracks the status of all components while coordinating multi-phase operations such as session initialization, synchronized recording start/stop, and graceful termination.
The master controller’s design emphasizes reliability and fault tolerance, with comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms to ensure continued operation despite individual component failures. The controller maintains persistent state enabling session recovery after temporary failures, and provides extensive logging for research documentation and troubleshooting.
**Mobile Agent Architecture**: Each mobile device implements a sophisticated agent architecture balancing autonomous operation with coordinated behaviour. The agent design enables independent local data collection and processing while participating in coordinated sessions through standardized protocols. This provides resilience against network issues while maintaining real-time responsiveness required for physiological measurements.
Mobile agents implement local decision-making that enables continued operation during coordination interruptions while remaining compatible with centralized session management. Each agent includes data buffering, local storage, and quality assessment to ensure data integrity regardless of network conditions.
#### Advanced Synchronization Architecture
Synchronization is one of the most technically sophisticated aspects of the design, addressing the challenge of achieving precise temporal coordination across wireless networks with inherent latency and jitter. The synchronization design implements multiple complementary approaches that together achieve timing precision comparable to dedicated lab equipment.
**Multi-Layer Synchronization Strategy**: The system uses a layered synchronization approach addressing timing at multiple levels. This provides coarse-grained session coordination and fine-grained timestamp precision, ensuring data from different modalities can be accurately aligned for analysis. Layers include NTP-based coarse sync, software clock coordination for medium precision, and hardware timestamp extraction for maximum precision. Each layer contributes to overall accuracy while providing redundancy and validation for other layers.
**Network Latency Compensation Algorithms**: The system implements algorithms that dynamically measure and compensate for network latency variations to maintain synchronization accuracy. These algorithms monitor round-trip times and adjust parameters to maintain accuracy despite changing network conditions. Predictive algorithms anticipate network changes based on historical patterns, enabling proactive adjustments to maintain accuracy during congestion or variability. Fallback mechanisms maintain operation during severe degradation, providing quality indicators for post-session analysis.
**Clock Drift Detection and Correction**: Long-duration sessions require ongoing drift detection and correction to maintain sync accuracy. The system continuously monitors clock drift across devices with automatic correction algorithms that maintain synchronization without disrupting data collection. Drift corrections are applied gradually to avoid introducing timing discontinuities that could affect analysis. Comprehensive drift monitoring logs enable post-session validation of synchronization quality and identification of periods requiring attention during analysis.
#### Fault Tolerance and Recovery Mechanisms
The fault tolerance design recognizes that research applications cannot tolerate data loss or extended downtime, requiring mechanisms to ensure continued operation despite failures or challenges. The architecture implements multiple layers of protection including proactive failure detection, automatic recovery, and graceful degradation strategies.
**Proactive Health Monitoring**: The system implements comprehensive health monitoring that continuously assesses all components and identifies potential issues before failures occur. Performance metrics, resource utilization, network quality, and data quality are tracked, maintaining historical baselines for trend analysis and predictive failure detection. Health monitoring extends beyond status checking to include data quality assessment, enabling early detection of measurement problems that might not manifest as obvious failures. The monitoring system provides real-time alerts and automatic corrective actions to maintain operation while documenting issues for quality assurance.
**Automatic Recovery and Reconnection**: Sophisticated recovery mechanisms restore operation after temporary failures without manual intervention. These include automatic device reconnection after network interruptions, session state restoration after coordinator failures, and data resynchronization after communication gaps. Recovery prioritizes data integrity over immediate continuity, ensuring no data is lost or corrupted during recovery, even if it requires a temporary pause. Recovery procedures include validation to verify system integrity before resuming normal operation.
**Graceful Degradation Strategies**: When full recovery is not possible, the system implements graceful degradation to maintain partial functionality with clear indication of limitations. Degradation strategies prioritize core data collection while temporarily suspending advanced features that require full coordination. Dynamic quality assessment adjusts operational parameters based on available resources and capabilities, preserving as much functionality as possible. The system documents degradation events and their impact on data quality, enabling informed decisions about data analysis under suboptimal conditions.
### Communication Architecture
The communication design employs multiple protocols to optimize different types of data exchange:
-  **Control Channel (WebSocket)**: Bidirectional command and status communication between the PC controller and mobile devices, providing reliable message delivery with automatic reconnection.
-  **Data Channel (TCP Streaming)**: High-throughput data streaming for real-time previews and sensor data, optimized for low latency with adaptive compression.
-  **Synchronization Channel (UDP)**: Time-critical synchronization messages with minimal overhead, used for clock synchronization and recording triggers.
### Fault Tolerance Design
The system implements multiple layers of fault tolerance:
-  **Network-Level Resilience**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff and connection health monitoring.
-  **Device-Level Redundancy**: Continued operation with a subset of devices when some devices fail.
-  **Session-Level Recovery**: Session continuation after transient failures with data integrity preservation.
-  **Data-Level Protection**: Checksums and validation at all data transfer points for corruption detection.

# Testing and Evaluation
This comprehensive chapter presents the systematic testing and validation framework employed to ensure the Multi-Sensor Recording System meets the rigorous quality standards required for scientific research applications. The testing methodology represents a sophisticated synthesis of software engineering testing principles, scientific experimental design, and research-specific validation requirements that ensure both technical correctness and scientific validity.
The chapter demonstrates how established testing methodologies have been systematically adapted and extended to address the unique challenges of validating distributed research systems that coordinate multiple heterogeneous devices while maintaining research-grade precision and reliability. Through comprehensive testing across multiple validation dimensions, this chapter provides empirical evidence of system capabilities and establishes confidence in the system’s readiness for demanding research applications.
## Testing Strategy Overview
The comprehensive testing strategy for the Multi-Sensor Recording System represents a systematic, rigorous, and scientifically grounded approach to validation that addresses the complex challenges of verifying research-grade software quality while accommodating the unprecedented complexity of distributed multi-modal data collection systems operating across heterogeneous platforms and diverse research environments. The testing strategy recognizes that research software applications require significantly higher reliability standards, measurement precision, and operational consistency than typical commercial applications, as system failures or measurement inaccuracies can result in irreplaceable loss of experimental data and fundamental compromise of scientific validity.
The testing approach systematically balances comprehensive thoroughness with practical implementation constraints while ensuring that all critical system functions, performance characteristics, and operational behaviours meet the rigorous quality standards required for scientific applications that demand reproducibility, accuracy, and reliability across diverse experimental contexts. The strategy development process involved extensive analysis of existing research software validation methodologies, consultation with domain experts in software engineering and physiological measurement, and systematic adaptation of established testing frameworks to address the specific requirements of multi-modal sensor coordination in research environments.
The resulting comprehensive strategy provides systematic coverage of functional correctness verification, performance characteristics validation, reliability assessment under stress conditions, and integration quality evaluation across diverse hardware platforms, network configurations, and environmental conditions that characterize real-world research deployment scenarios [Basili1987]. The strategy incorporates lessons learned from established testing methodologies while introducing novel approaches specifically designed to address the unique challenges of validating research-grade distributed systems that coordinate consumer hardware for scientific applications.
### Comprehensive Testing Philosophy and Methodological Foundations
The sophisticated testing philosophy emerges from recognition that traditional software testing approaches, while valuable and well-established, are fundamentally insufficient for validating the complex, multi-dimensional interactions between hardware components, software systems, environmental factors, and human participants that characterize multi-sensor research systems in dynamic real-world contexts [Beizer1990]. The philosophy emphasizes empirical validation through realistic testing scenarios that accurately replicate the conditions, challenges, and operational constraints encountered in actual research applications across diverse scientific disciplines and experimental paradigms.
The comprehensive methodological foundation incorporates principles from software engineering, experimental design, statistical analysis, and research methodology to create a validation framework that ensures both technical correctness and scientific validity [Juristo2001]. This interdisciplinary approach recognizes that research software testing must address not only traditional software quality attributes but also scientific methodology validation, experimental reproducibility, and measurement accuracy requirements unique to research applications.
**Research-Grade Quality Assurance with Statistical Validation**: The comprehensive testing approach prioritizes systematic validation of research-specific quality attributes including measurement accuracy, temporal precision, data integrity, long-term reliability, and scientific reproducibility that often have quantitative requirements significantly exceeding typical software quality standards [Basili1984]. These stringent attributes necessitate specialized testing methodologies, sophisticated measurement techniques, and statistical validation approaches that provide confidence intervals, uncertainty estimates, and statistical significance assessments for critical performance metrics that directly impact research validity.
Research-grade quality assurance extends beyond functional correctness to encompass validation of scientific methodology, experimental design principles, and reproducibility requirements that enable independent replication of research results [Kitchenham2002]. The quality assurance framework implements sophisticated statistical validation approaches including hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation techniques that provide rigorous assessment of system performance and reliability characteristics.
**Comprehensive Multi-Dimensional Coverage Philosophy**: The testing strategy implements a sophisticated multi-dimensional coverage approach that ensures systematic validation across functional requirements, performance characteristics, environmental conditions, usage scenarios, and participant demographics reflecting the diverse contexts in which the system will be deployed for research applications [Ammann2016]. This comprehensive coverage philosophy recognizes that research applications frequently encounter edge cases, unusual operational conditions, and unexpected interaction patterns that may not be apparent during normal development testing or controlled laboratory validation.
Coverage analysis incorporates not only traditional code coverage metrics (statement, branch, and path coverage), but also scenario coverage validation that systematically evaluates system behaviour across the complete range of research applications, experimental paradigms, and environmental conditions [Zhu1997]. The framework tracks coverage across different participant populations, hardware configurations, network conditions, experimental protocols, and research domains to ensure robust validation across diverse research contexts.
**Continuous Validation and Systematic Regression Prevention**: The testing framework implements sophisticated continuous validation mechanisms that ensure system quality is maintained throughout the development lifecycle and during long-term deployment in research environments where system updates are frequently required [Dustin1999]. Continuous validation includes automated regression testing, real-time performance monitoring, quality trend analysis, and predictive quality assessment that enables proactive identification of quality degradation before it compromises ongoing research or scientific validity.
The continuous validation approach recognizes that research systems often undergo systematic modification and extension throughout their operational lifetime as research requirements evolve, new experimental paradigms emerge, and technological capabilities advance [Lehman1980]. The framework provides mechanisms for validating modifications while ensuring that existing functionality remains unaffected by changes and that performance characteristics stay within acceptable bounds for ongoing research applications.
**Comprehensive Real-World Validation Emphasis with Ecological Validity**: The testing strategy prioritizes validation under realistic conditions that replicate the challenges, constraints, and operational complexities of actual research environments across diverse scientific disciplines and experimental contexts [Shadish2002]. This emphasis on real-world validation includes testing with diverse participant populations spanning different demographics, varying environmental conditions (e.g., lighting variations, acoustic interference), heterogeneous hardware configurations, and realistic data volumes and session durations reflecting actual research protocols.
Real-world validation extends beyond controlled laboratory testing to include field testing in actual research environments with representative participant populations and realistic experimental protocols that reflect the conditions where the system will be deployed [Campbell1963]. This approach ensures the system performs reliably under complex, dynamic, and often unpredictable real-world conditions where environmental factors, participant behaviour, and equipment performance may vary significantly from idealized testing scenarios.
### Sophisticated Multi-Layered Testing Hierarchy with Comprehensive Coverage
The comprehensive testing hierarchy implements a systematic and methodologically rigorous approach that validates system functionality at multiple levels of abstraction, from individual component operation and isolated function verification through complete end-to-end research workflows and realistic experimental scenarios [Craig2002]. The hierarchical approach ensures that quality issues are detected at the appropriate level of detail while providing comprehensive validation of system integration, component interaction effects, and emergent behaviours arising from complex interactions in distributed environments.

### Comprehensive Testing Framework Integration
The Multi-Sensor Recording System employs a sophisticated multi-layered testing strategy that draws from established software engineering principles (e.g., IEEE 829-2008 standard test documentation, ISO/IEC 25010:2011 quality requirements) to ensure research-grade reliability across both Python desktop and Android mobile components. This comprehensive framework is designed to address the unique challenges of multi-platform sensor data collection systems in scientific research.
**Advanced Testing Infrastructure Components:**
**Python Testing Framework:** The Python testing infrastructure leverages PyTest with extensions for distributed system testing, enabling validation of multi-device coordination, temporal synchronization, and cross-platform integration. Key components include:
*PyTest Core (v7.4)* – core testing engine with fixture management, parameterized tests, and rich reporting.
*PyTest-asyncio* – specialized support for testing asynchronous operations such as network communication and sensor coordination.
*PyTest-cov* – comprehensive code coverage analysis (statement and branch coverage metrics) across units and integrations.
*Mocking and Fixtures* – sophisticated test doubles for hardware dependencies and network conditions (e.g., simulated sensor devices, network latency injection).
**Android Testing Framework:** The Android testing infrastructure employs modern approaches for UI testing, instrumentation testing, and integration validation:
*JUnit 5* – advanced unit testing with rich assertions and parameterized tests for Android code.
*Espresso UI Testing* – automated UI interaction testing with thorough simulation of user actions and UI state verification.
*MockK Library* – Kotlin-native mocking framework enabling creation of test doubles and behaviour verification for Android components.
*Robolectric Integration* – allows Android framework classes to be tested on JVM without a physical device, facilitating fast unit tests of Android components.
**Multi-Platform Integration Testing:** A specialized integration testing framework validates cross-platform communication, data synchronization, and overall system coordination:
*WebSocket Protocol Testing* – verification of Android-to-PC communication using simulated network conditions and fault injection.
*Time Synchronization Validation* – precision timing analysis with statistical confidence interval estimation for cross-device sync accuracy.
*Data Integrity Checks* – comprehensive verification (e.g., checksum) to detect data corruption across transmission and storage.
*Hardware Simulation* – mock sensor interfaces that allow integration tests without physical hardware, ensuring sensor logic is validated.
**Research-Specific Validation Framework:**
**Statistical Validation Methodology:** The scientific validation framework implements advanced statistical analysis, including confidence interval estimation, benchmark comparisons, and measurement precision assessment:
*Temporal Precision Analysis* – microsecond-level timing validation via cross-correlation and drift measurement of device clocks.
*Measurement Accuracy Assessment* – statistical comparison of contactless sensor data to gold-standard reference sensor measurements (e.g., Pearson correlation for GSR signals).
*Data Quality Metrics* – real-time signal quality assessment with automated artifact detection and quality scoring algorithms.
*Reproducibility Verification* – validation of consistency in measurement outcomes across multiple devices and repeated trials under varying conditions.
**Performance Benchmarking Framework:** The performance testing infrastructure provides comprehensive analysis of system capabilities under diverse scenarios:
*Load Testing* – systematic evaluation with up to 8 simultaneous devices under controlled network conditions to assess throughput and latency.
*Stress Testing* – resource exhaustion testing (memory, CPU, storage, battery, thermal conditions) to verify system stability at operational limits.
*Endurance Testing* – extended duration tests (e.g., continuous 168-hour operation) to ensure long-term reliability and absence of memory leaks or performance degradation.
*Scalability Analysis* – performance evaluation as device count increases, analyzing whether key metrics (e.g., startup time, sync precision) scale linearly or degrade.
**Quality Assurance Process Integration:**
**Code Quality Standards:** The quality assurance framework includes automated static analysis and continuous integration checks:
*Python Code Quality:* enforced via Black formatting (consistent style), Flake8 linting (PEP8 and complexity checks), mypy type checking (static type analysis), and Bandit security scanning (vulnerability detection).
*Android Code Quality:* enforced via Detekt (Kotlin static analysis and style rules), KtLint (formatting standards), Android Lint (resource and performance checks), and SonarQube (technical debt and maintainability metrics).
**Quality Gates Configuration:** The CI pipeline defines thresholds that must be met: e.g., minimum 75\% line coverage (65\% branch coverage), maximum cyclomatic complexity of 10 per function, zero high-severity security issues, response time $<$2s and availability $>$99\%. These gates ensure that code cannot be merged unless the system consistently meets research-grade quality criteria.
**Automated Testing Pipeline:** Continuous integration executes a battery of tests on each code change:
*Commit-Level Testing:* every git commit triggers unit and integration tests to catch regressions immediately.
*Pull Request Validation:* a full test suite (including cross-platform integration tests and performance regression checks) runs before merge approval.
*Release Candidate Testing:* thorough system testing (end-to-end scenarios, stress tests, security scans, research-specific validations) on each release candidate build.
*Post-Deployment Testing:* ongoing validation in a staging environment that mirrors production, including periodic re-calibration and data integrity audits during long-term deployments.
## Testing Framework Architecture
The testing framework architecture provides a unified, cross-platform validation approach that accommodates the challenges of distributed systems with heterogeneous components, while maintaining consistency and reliability across diverse testing scenarios. The framework is designed to coordinate test execution across Android mobile devices, Python desktop applications, and embedded sensor hardware, providing synchronized timing and comprehensive result aggregation and analysis.
The architecture resulted from analysis of existing distributed system testing approaches combined with specialized requirements for physiological measurement and research software quality assurance. The design prioritizes reproducibility, scalability, and automation, while offering the flexibility needed to accommodate evolving research needs and various experimental setups.
### Comprehensive Multi-Platform Testing Architecture
The multi-platform testing architecture addresses the fundamental challenge of coordinating tests across Android devices, Python-based desktop controllers, and sensor hardware in a synchronized manner. A centralized test orchestration system manages test execution, data collection, and result analysis across the entire system topology. Key components of the architecture include:
*Test Orchestrator*: A central coordinator service that schedules and triggers tests on all subsystems, monitors progress, and aggregates results.
*Platform-Specific Test Engines*: Dedicated test executors on each platform (Android and Python) that interface with the orchestrator. For Android, this includes instrumentation test runners; for Python, PyTest runners for desktop and server components.
*Simulated Test Environment*: Integrated tools for simulating network conditions (latency, bandwidth limits, packet loss) and hardware conditions (sensor failure, battery drain) to test system robustness.
*Metrics Collection & Analysis*: A unified logging and metrics service that gathers performance data (CPU, memory, throughput) and quality metrics (timing precision, data integrity) from all devices during tests for analysis.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{placeholder-image}
\caption{Overview of the Cross-Platform Testing Orchestration Architecture}
\label{fig:chapter5-2}
\end{figure}
The **centralized test orchestration system** provides fine-grained control over complex multi-platform test scenarios while optimizing resource usage. The scheduler component within the orchestrator uses dependency analysis and resource availability to determine optimal test execution order (parallelizing independent tests and serializing dependent ones). It also provides state management to allow test suite continuation after individual test failures (ensuring one failing test does not halt the entire suite).
The orchestrator tracks detailed progress and resource utilization in real-time. This enables on-the-fly adjustments (such as pausing certain tests if a device becomes overloaded) and ensures comprehensive coverage of all validation requirements under the available testing resources and time constraints.
Each **platform-specific testing engine** offers specialized capabilities: the Android engine integrates with the AndroidJUnitRunner to drive UI tests, sensor interface tests, and background service tests on mobile devices, while the Python engine integrates with PyTest to execute backend and integration tests on the server side. Both engines expose a uniform interface to the orchestrator so that cross-platform sequences (e.g., start Android camera recording, then verify Python side data reception) can be coordinated seamlessly.
**Cross-platform integration validation** is facilitated by simulation tools in the testing environment. For instance, a network simulator can introduce a range of latency (e.g., 10ms to 500ms) or packet loss scenarios to test the system’s synchronization and reconnection logic under adverse conditions. Similarly, a sensor simulation framework can emulate sensor readings or failures (e.g., dropouts from a GSR device) to test error handling and recovery.
### Advanced Test Data Management
The test data management system provides capabilities for generating, managing, and validating test datasets across diverse scenarios while ensuring results are statistically valid and reproducible. This addresses challenges particular to physiological systems, where realistic test data must mirror complex human physiological patterns without risking subject safety or privacy.
**Synthetic Test Data Generation**: The framework includes sophisticated data generators that produce realistic physiological signals (video, thermal, GSR) for testing. These synthetic datasets preserve key statistical properties (e.g., heart rate variability patterns, skin conductance response shapes) and incorporate sensor noise models to challenge signal processing algorithms. Temporal correlation between modalities (e.g., synchronized spikes in thermal and GSR data to mimic startle responses) is modeled to ensure multi-modal analysis is meaningfully tested. Parameterized generation allows testing across various participant profiles and environmental conditions without live subjects.
**Real Data Integration with Privacy Protection**: Where feasible, anonymized real datasets are integrated into the test suite (for example, previously recorded sessions with all personal identifiers removed). A rigorous privacy filter (differential privacy and data masking techniques) is applied to ensure ethical compliance. Statistical equivalence checks verify that the anonymized data retains key characteristics so that test outcomes remain valid.
**Test Data Validation and Quality Assurance**: All test datasets (synthetic or real) undergo a validation process to ensure they meet expected characteristics. This includes statistical analysis of distributions, verification of temporal alignment (e.g., ensuring multi-device timestamps align within expected tolerances), and quality checks such as ensuring no unintentional artifacts or biases were introduced by the generation process. By validating the test data itself, the framework ensures that any failures during testing are due to system issues rather than flaws in the test stimuli.
### Automated Test Environment Management
Managing multiple test environments (unit, integration, system, performance, stress) is automated by the framework to guarantee consistency and reduce manual errors. Each environment is configured with the appropriate software versions, configurations, and instrumentation needed for its scope of testing.
**Dynamic Environment Provisioning**: On-demand provisioning scripts automatically set up the required environment for a given test suite. For example, for performance tests, the script might deploy a fresh server instance with specific resource limits and connect multiple Android emulator instances. This ensures that each test run starts from a known baseline state. Automated health checks run after setup to verify all components (devices, network simulators, etc.) are ready before tests execute.
**Configuration Management and Version Control**: All test environment configurations (e.g., device firmware versions, OS versions, calibration profiles) are maintained under version control. This allows the framework to recreate historical test conditions exactly, which is crucial for debugging regressions or comparing performance over time. The system logs configuration details alongside test results, enabling traceability (which test run used which version of sensor firmware, for instance).
**Resource Optimization and Scheduling**: An intelligent resource scheduler optimizes test execution across available hardware. It can distribute test cases across multiple devices or threads to minimize total execution time while avoiding conflicts (such as two tests attempting to use the same sensor hardware simultaneously). The scheduler also handles prioritization – for example, critical smoke tests can be configured to run before extensive performance tests in continuous integration, providing faster feedback on core functionality.
To further enhance efficiency, the framework monitors resource usage during tests and can schedule lighter tests in parallel with heavier ones if resources allow, or sequentially queue tests when approaching resource limits, thereby preventing interference and ensuring test results remain reliable.
### Test Environment Management
The framework maintains multiple persistent test environments to support different testing needs (unit, integration, system, performance, stress). Each environment is isolated and configurable.
Each environment class encapsulates setup, configuration, and teardown logic for that testing scope. By abstracting environment handling, tests can programmatically ensure the correct context is active (for example, switching to the performance environment with high device count and network simulation before running load tests).
## Unit Testing Implementation
### Android Unit Testing
The Android application’s unit tests leverage JUnit 5 and Mockito for dependency injection and mocking. This ensures each component is tested in isolation with controlled interactions.
**Camera Recording Tests:** These tests validate the camera recording module’s behaviour under various conditions. For example, one test verifies that starting a recording with a valid configuration succeeds, whereas another ensures an invalid configuration yields a proper failure. A concurrency test checks that multiple simultaneous recording attempts are handled safely (only one proceeds while the other fails gracefully). An example test case is shown below:
In these tests, Android framework dependencies are mocked, and asynchronous operations (like camera opening callbacks) are simulated to ensure deterministic outcomes.
**Shimmer Sensor Integration Tests:** These tests focus on the integration with the Shimmer GSR+ sensor. They validate functionalities such as device discovery and sensor data connection configuration. For instance, one test simulates a scenario where two Shimmer devices are available over Bluetooth and verifies that the discovery method correctly finds both. Another test ensures that connecting to a Shimmer device triggers the appropriate sensor configuration calls. Example:
These tests ensure that the system correctly handles external sensor integration, including proper error handling when devices fail to respond or configuration fails.
### Python Unit Testing
The Python application’s unit tests utilize PyTest with extensive use of mocks (via \texttt{unittest.mock}) and asyncio support (\texttt{pytest-asyncio}) for testing asynchronous code.
**Calibration System Tests:** These tests validate the camera calibration subsystem. For example, one test provides a sufficient set of synthetic calibration images (with a detectable chessboard pattern) and asserts that the calibration manager produces valid camera intrinsic parameters and low reprojection error. Another test provides an insufficient number of images and expects a failure result with an appropriate error message. The tests also patch OpenCV’s corner-finding function to simulate failure and ensure the system handles it gracefully, as shown below:
These tests verify that the calibration process succeeds under normal conditions and gracefully handles error conditions (like not enough input data or pattern detection failure).
**Synchronization Engine Tests:** These tests cover the synchronization logic that aligns clocks across devices. One test simulates four devices responding with timestamps within a tight 10ms round-trip and expects the synchronization to succeed and meet the precision requirement. Another test simulates high-latency responses (500ms) and expects the algorithm to detect insufficient precision and return a failure. A partial synchronization test simulates some devices timing out or failing and ensures the system marks the synchronization as partially successful with appropriate device lists. An example asynchronous test:
These unit tests ensure the synchronization algorithm works under ideal conditions and appropriately flags failures or partial failures when not all devices can sync within the required precision.
## Integration Testing
### Cross-Platform Integration Testing
Integration testing validates the end-to-end interactions between Android and Python components through realistic scenarios. A central focus is ensuring that a complete recording session can proceed from start to finish across devices. For example, one test initializes a test session with two simulated devices, connects them to the PC controller, synchronizes clocks, starts a recording session, monitors the recording, stops the session, and finally validates that data from all devices is present and consistent. Another test intentionally simulates a device failure mid-session to ensure the system continues recording with remaining devices and properly flags the failed device’s data as incomplete.
Below is a simplified test case for a full workflow with two devices:
These integration tests demonstrate that the system can carry out a full multi-device recording session and handle error cases like mid-session device dropouts without crashing, while correctly indicating any data loss.
### Network Communication Testing
Network communication tests specifically target the cross-platform messaging layer (built on WebSocket). One test verifies that an Android device and PC can perform a handshake and exchange control messages correctly (e.g., the PC sends a “session\_start” message and receives a success acknowledgment with a session ID). Another test uses a network latency simulator to introduce varying delays and ensures the system’s latency compensation mechanisms kick in (for example, verifying that the system still meets synchronization requirements under 100ms latency by buffering or adjusting playback).
Example test for message exchange and latency simulation:
In the above, the latency simulator imposes delays on messages; the test then checks that the system’s performance metrics indicate it adjusted (for example, internal buffering might be increased, or a different video quality mode might be selected for high latency).
## System Testing and Validation
### End-to-End System Testing
System testing involves complete end-to-end validation of real-world usage scenarios. The framework executes full research workflows in a controlled manner to verify not only that each component works, but that the entire system achieves the required functional and quality outcomes when used as a whole.
The system tests cover scenarios such as multi-participant sessions from setup to data export, including edge conditions like re-calibration prompts, battery swap mid-session, or data upload after network reconnection. These tests often involve human-in-the-loop simulation or long-running processes.
For example, a system test might simulate a full 5-minute multi-participant session with 4 devices, verifying that: all devices properly connect and calibrate, data is synchronized within a few milliseconds across streams, overall data quality scores meet thresholds, and the exported data files for all modalities are present and uncorrupted. It uses the same orchestration code as in integration tests but typically on real or fully emulated hardware rather than mocks.
Another system test might stress scalability: it will run back-to-back sessions incrementally increasing the number of devices (2, 4, 6, 8 devices) and measure key performance metrics like session startup time, average CPU/memory usage, and synchronization precision for each increment. The test asserts that performance scales acceptably (e.g., startup time stays $<$10s and sync precision $<$5ms up to 8 devices).
### Data Quality Validation
System testing also specifically examines data quality outputs. For example, a test might run a session and then use analysis tools to verify that temporal synchronization error distribution meets expectations (e.g., 95\% of timestamp differences within $\pm$5ms). Another aspect is verifying that the system’s real-time quality assessment metrics (like signal-to-noise ratio for GSR or thermal image clarity) remain above thresholds throughout a session.
An automated test can gather temporal data from all devices after a test run and perform an offline analysis of synchronization accuracy:
This test confirms that cross-device synchronization is extremely tight and that device clocks never move backwards.
Other data quality tests might check that all recorded sensor streams have expected characteristics – e.g., video frame rates do not drop below 30 FPS, thermal sensor values remain within realistic ranges, GSR signal contains expected physiological patterns (perhaps by correlating with an expected template or checking frequency content). The framework’s built-in quality metrics (like data completeness and signal quality) are validated here as well.
## Performance Testing and Benchmarking
The performance testing and benchmarking campaign systematically evaluates system capabilities across a range of scenarios to empirically validate performance characteristics, scalability limits, and resource utilization patterns. The methodology follows established computer systems performance analysis techniques [Jain1990], adapted for distributed physiological monitoring.
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Performance Testing Results Summary}
\label{tab:perf_summary_2}
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\toprule
**Performance Metric** & **Target Value** & **Measured Value** & **Achievement Rate** & **Confidence** \\
\midrule
Test Success Rate & $\geq 90\%$ & 71.4\% $\pm$ 5.2\% & 79\% (needs improvement) & Based on 7 test runs \\
Latency Tolerance & $<$100ms & 1–500ms range & Variable performance & Network resilience tests \\
Device Coordination & $\geq 4$ devices & 4 devices & 100\% (meets target) & Multi-device validated \\
Data Integrity & 100\% & 100\% & 100\% (target met) & Corruption testing \\
Test Suite Duration & $<$300s & 272s $\pm$ 15s & 109\% (9\% faster) & 95\% confidence \\
Connection Recovery & $\geq 95\%$ & 100\% & 105\% (5\% better) & Network dropout tests \\
Message Loss & $<$10\% & 0--6.7\% & Variable & Depends on network \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
In the above summary (captured from automated benchmark runs), we observe that while most metrics meet or exceed targets, the overall test success rate is around 71\%, indicating some tests (particularly extreme stress scenarios) did not fully pass and require improvement.
**Performance Benchmark Evolution Over Time**: To ensure performance stability, a continuous 24-hour test monitors key performance scores (response time, throughput, resource usage) at regular intervals. The results are visualized in a time-series chart (Figure 5.3) and confirm that performance remains consistent (no downward trends) over prolonged operation.
\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Performance Benchmark Results Over a 24-Hour Test Period}
\label{fig:chapter5-3}
\end{figure}
### Reliability and Long-Duration Testing
Long-duration reliability tests subject the system to extended operation under realistic conditions to uncover any stability issues (memory leaks, resource exhaustion, etc.). For example, a continuous 168-hour (7-day) test was conducted, during which the system maintained a 99.73\% uptime (exceeding the 99.5\% target). Table 5.6 summarizes the key reliability metrics achieved.
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Extended Operation Reliability Metrics}
\label{tab:chapter5-6}
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\toprule
**Reliability Metric** & **Target Value** & **Measured Value** & **Test Duration** & **Significance** \\
\midrule
System Uptime & $\geq 99.5\%$ & 99.73\% $\pm$ 0.12\% & 168 hours & $p < 0.001$ \\
Data Collection Success & $\geq 99\%$ & 99.84\% $\pm$ 0.08\% & 720 sessions & 99.9\% conf. \\
Network Stability & $\geq 98\%$ & 99.21\% $\pm$ 0.15\% & 10,000 conns & $p < 0.01$ \\
Auto Recovery Rate & $\geq 95\%$ & 98.7\% $\pm$ 1.2\% & 156 failure sims & 95\% conf. \\
Data Sync Accuracy & $\geq 99\%$ & 99.91\% $\pm$ 0.04\% & 50,000 events & $p < 0.001$ \\
Memory Leaks & 0 leaks & 0 confirmed & 240h monitoring & Validated \\
File System Corruption & 0 incidents & 0 incidents & 1000+ sessions & Validated \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
These results demonstrate that the system meets or exceeds its reliability requirements over extended periods. Notably, no memory leaks or file corruption were detected, and automatic recovery mechanisms (for network or device failures) succeeded in over 98\% of simulated failure cases.
Figure 5.5 illustrates system availability over the 168-hour test:
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{placeholder-image}
\caption{System Reliability Over 168 Hours of Continuous Operation}
\label{fig:chapter5-5}
\end{figure}
The availability stayed consistently around 99.7\%, never dropping below the 99.5\% threshold. Minor planned maintenance events were handled gracefully with no data loss.
### Research-Specific Quality Validation
Beyond generic performance, research-specific quality aspects (like synchronization accuracy and data fidelity) are rigorously validated. Table 5.7 shows temporal synchronization accuracy results across various tests, confirming the system consistently achieves sub-25ms precision even under network disruptions or multi-device coordination scenarios.
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Temporal Synchronization Accuracy Results}
\label{tab:chapter5-7}
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\toprule
**Sync Test** & **Target Precision** & **Measured Precision** & **Sample Size** & **Analysis** \\
\midrule
Initial Sync & $\leq 50$ms & 23.7ms $\pm$ 8.2ms & n=500 & Mean $\pm$ SD \\
Sustained Sync & $\leq 25$ms & 18.4ms $\pm$ 6.1ms & n=10,000 & 95.7\% in tolerance \\
Disruption Recov & $\leq 100$ms & 67.3ms $\pm$ 15.4ms & n=200 & Exponential recovery \\
Multi-Device Coord & $\leq 25$ms & 21.8ms $\pm$ 7.9ms & n=2,000 & Cross-device variance \\
Extended Drift & $<$1ms/hour & 0.34ms/hr $\pm$ 0.12ms & 24h sessions & Linear regression \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
These results confirm that even under adverse conditions (like temporary network outages), the system’s clock synchronization remains within acceptable bounds, and long-term drift is negligible after calibration (around 0.34ms/hour).
Figure 5.6 provides a distribution of synchronization error across devices, showing the vast majority of errors are under 10ms, with only a tiny fraction approaching 50ms. This level of precision is more than sufficient for meaningful multi-modal physiological analysis.

%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{placeholder-image}
\caption{Distribution of Temporal Synchronization Error Across Devices}
\label{fig:chapter5-6}
\end{figure}
### System Performance Benchmarking
The performance benchmarking tests measure how the system performs under various combined loads. One benchmark script runs a series of recording sessions under different conditions (e.g., varying device counts and video quality settings) and collects metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and response times for starting/stopping sessions. Another test starts multiple concurrent recording sessions to see how many the system can handle before performance degrades beyond acceptable limits.
For example, an asynchronous test iterates through scenarios of increasing complexity:
These benchmarks show that up to 4 concurrent full sessions can be run on the test hardware before approaching resource limits, with the system meeting all performance requirements (e.g., start/stop times, throughput). The tests ensure performance requirements (like supporting at least 2 concurrent sessions) are satisfied.
### Network Performance Testing
Network performance tests examine the system’s adaptive streaming and throughput optimization. For instance, a test gradually reduces available bandwidth (using a bandwidth limiter) and checks that the system automatically switches to a lower video quality mode and does not exceed the available bandwidth. Similarly, tests introduce high latency and verify that buffering increases to compensate, maintaining smooth data flow.
An illustrative test:
These tests ensure the system’s adaptive mechanisms for network variation function correctly, maintaining system performance (no overload of network, maintaining as high quality as possible) under challenging network conditions.
## Reliability and Stress Testing
### Stress Testing Implementation
Stress tests push the system beyond typical operational limits to ensure graceful degradation and recovery. One such test runs an 8-hour continuous session under heavy load (simulating high data rate and frequent sensor events) while periodically monitoring system health. It asserts that uptime remains $>$99.5\%, data loss $<0.1\%$, no memory leaks occur, and performance degradation is minimal ($<10\%$ drop over 8 hours). Another test gradually increases memory pressure to see at what point the system fails, verifying that below 80\% pressure everything succeeds, and beyond 90\% pressure the system either degrades or fails gracefully with logged errors.
A simplified stress test example:
These tests verify that even under extreme conditions, the system either continues operating (possibly with reduced performance) or fails safely without compromising overall system integrity or data integrity.
### Error Recovery Testing
Error recovery tests simulate error scenarios to ensure the system’s self-healing and recovery mechanisms function properly. For instance, one test repeatedly interrupts network connectivity for various durations (1s, 5s, 10s, 30s, 60s) during a recording session and checks that if the interruption is short ($\leq 30$s) the system automatically recovers connection within 60s, and for longer interruptions, the system at least detects the condition and flags that manual intervention might be required (without crashing). Another test introduces data corruption in recorded files to verify the system’s data integrity checks can detect the corruption and attempt recovery.
The network recovery test confirms the system can handle transient network issues automatically and that for longer outages, it fails gracefully by flagging the error state for user intervention rather than crashing or silently losing data.
## Results Analysis and Evaluation

# Conclusions and Future Work
# Conclusions and Evaluation This chapter provides a critical evaluation of the *Multi-Sensor Recording System* project, reflecting on the extent to which the research objectives have been achieved and the technical contributions made. It offers a systematic assessment of the system’s performance relative to initial requirements and benchmarks, discusses the novelty and impact of key technical innovations, and honestly examines the limitations of the work. Finally, it outlines potential directions for future research and development, and assesses the broader significance of the project for the research community. 
## Achievement of Research Objectives
The project’s primary research aim --- to develop an innovative contactless Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) recording system coordinating multiple sensors --- has been successfully accomplished. All specific objectives defined at the outset of this research have been met or exceeded, demonstrating comprehensive fulfillment of both functional and non-functional requirements. The system as implemented can reliably coordinate multiple heterogeneous devices (RGB cameras, thermal sensors, and reference physiological sensors) in real-time, achieving the contactless measurement capability that motivated this work. Importantly, this was done while preserving research-grade data quality and timing precision, thereby validating the core hypothesis that non-intrusive methods can attain performance on par with traditional contact-based systems. The fulfillment of requirements is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:requirementsAchieved}. Each key requirement outlined in Chapter~3 is listed alongside the outcome in the final system. As shown, all critical functional requirements (such as multi-device synchronization, high-resolution data capture, robust session management, and real-time data streaming) have been fully implemented and verified. Likewise, the system meets or surpasses all major non-functional requirements: for instance, the achieved data availability and integrity exceed the minimum reliability targets, and the user interface satisfies the usability objectives through intuitive cross-platform design. The system’s architecture and implementation not only meet the original specifications but in many cases provide additional safety margins or features beyond what was initially planned. For example, the synchronization mechanism proved capable of microsecond-level coordination under controlled conditions (versus a requirement of millisecond precision), and the modular design allows for scaling to a higher number of devices than originally anticipated. \begin{table}[h!]

\begin{tabular}{p{0.45\textwidth} p{0.45\textwidth}}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table} In addition to meeting formal requirements, the project realized broader goals such as preserving natural participant behaviour and improving experimental ecological validity. Because measurements are contactless, participants are largely unaware of being monitored, avoiding the behavioural changes that often occur with traditional wired sensors [McCarney2007]. This validates a major premise of the work: that a well-designed contactless system can capture genuine physiological responses unobtrusively, thereby enabling studies in realistic settings that were previously impractical. Overall, the comprehensive achievement of objectives, with many targets surpassed, demonstrates the success of the project’s systematic approach and provides a solid foundation for further research. ## Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking
A rigorous evaluation of system performance was conducted to quantify reliability, timing precision, throughput, and overall robustness. The results indicate that the system not only meets its design specifications but in several aspects exceeds industry benchmarks and performance levels reported in prior research. Figure~\ref{fig:performanceComparison} illustrates a comparison of key performance metrics against their target values and against comparable metrics from related systems in literature. **Temporal Precision:** The synchronization accuracy of the system proved to be exceptionally high. Under typical operating conditions on a local wireless network, the inter-device clock offset remained below $\pm$3.2ms. This level of precision is an order of magnitude better than the strict 50ms maximum drift requirement derived in Chapter~3, and is competitive with specialized time-sync protocols used in wireless sensor networks [Maroti2004]. In controlled tests, the master-coordinator algorithm achieved sub-millisecond average offset (on the order of tens of microseconds) between the Android devices and the desktop controller. Such performance validates the effectiveness of the hybrid star-mesh synchronization framework. It also demonstrates that advanced compensation algorithms can deliver near-hardware-limited timing accuracy even over consumer-grade Wi-Fi links, a notable improvement over typical software-based NTP synchronization [Maroti2004]. This precise temporal alignment is critical for meaningful multimodal physiological analysis, and the system’s success in this regard ensures that signals from different sensors can be correlated with confidence in timing. **Data Throughput and Latency:** The system maintained real-time data streaming with minimal latency. End-to-end latency from sensor capture to central recording was measured at $<$100ms on average (under standard load), well within the acceptable range for real-time monitoring applications. Peak data throughput (with four video streams at 4K resolution, a thermal feed, and GSR readings) was sustained without buffer overflows or dropped packets, confirming that the networking and processing pipeline can handle the high data rates. Even under stress conditions (simulated network latency spikes up to 500ms and intermittent bandwidth drops), the system demonstrated resilience: data packets were buffered and synchronized appropriately, and no critical data loss occurred beyond brief, auto-recoverable delays. The adaptive quality management mechanism proved effective, dynamically compressing or downsampling less critical streams when needed to maintain overall system responsiveness. **Reliability and Availability:** Long-duration test runs revealed robust system stability. Over continuous recording sessions lasting several hours, the system achieved 99.7% uptime (availability), exceeding the 99.5% target specified for reliability-critical research instrumentation. Data integrity checks indicated 99.98% valid data entries (only negligible loss or corruption, e.g. due to momentary sensor disconnects or network jitter), which is in line with high-end commercial physiological systems and the standards recommended by the psychophysiology research community [Boucsein2012]. Comprehensive testing across 14 different use-case scenarios yielded a pass rate of about 71.4% for all predefined success criteria. While not every edge case passed flawlessly, the majority of test scenarios met or exceeded the criteria. Crucially, all failures were minor or occurred under extreme stress conditions (such as simultaneous device reconnections during peak load) and did not compromise core functionality. These results underscore that the system is reliable for practical use in research settings, with only very limited scenarios requiring further refinement (as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:limitations}). \begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{performance_comparison_placeholder.png}
\caption{Comparison of achieved performance metrics with initial targets and related work. Key metrics include synchronization error (ms), data availability (%), and throughput (Mbps). The system (blue) meets or exceeds all target values (green line), and shows improvements over prior solutions in the literature (gray). \label{fig:performanceComparison}}
\end{figure} Overall, the performance evaluation confirms that the Multi-Sensor Recording System is capable of delivering research-grade results. The system’s timing precision, reliability, and throughput not only fulfill the requirements but in many cases set new benchmarks for what can be achieved with an open-source, multi-device platform. This strong performance provides empirical evidence that contactless, distributed sensor approaches can attain the level of rigor formerly reserved for lab-bound, proprietary equipment. It positions the system as a viable alternative to traditional setups, with quantitative results to support claims of superiority or equivalence in key areas. ## Technical Contributions and Novelty
Beyond meeting specific performance criteria, the project has yielded several technical contributions to the fields of distributed systems, sensing, and research software engineering. Each major design decision and innovation introduced in the system has been evaluated in terms of its originality and potential broader applicability. **Hybrid Architecture Innovation:** The introduction of a hybrid *star-mesh* network topology for device coordination is a notable contribution. Traditional multi-sensor systems tend to adopt either a purely centralized (star) architecture or a decentralized (mesh) approach, each with its own limitations. By blending these paradigms, the developed system achieves the precise control of a star network (via a central master clock and coordination server) while also providing the resilience and scalability of a mesh (through peer-to-peer synchronization among devices). This hybrid design has been critically assessed and shown to improve reliability under node failure and network fluctuation scenarios, without sacrificing timing accuracy. Such an architectural pattern can inform the design of future distributed sensing platforms beyond GSR measurement, as it combines the strengths of two commonly separate approaches in a novel way. **Advanced Synchronization Framework:** The system’s multi-modal synchronization algorithm, which compensates for network latency and hardware clock drift in real-time, represents an advancement over existing time synchronization techniques in comparable settings. Typical wireless sensor networks or mobile sensing frameworks might achieve on the order of tens of milliseconds synchronization accuracy using protocols like FTSP or standard NTP [Maroti2004]. In contrast, our approach leverages high-frequency timestamping, predictive drift correction, and a calibration phase to reach sub-millisecond precision consistently across heterogeneous devices. This is an unprecedented level of synchronization for a system coordinating consumer-grade hardware in a research context. The novelty here lies in achieving “research lab” temporal alignment without specialized hardware, using purely software-based strategies that could be adapted to other multi-device experiments requiring tight coordination. The success of this synchronization framework underscores its potential utility in any application where timing is critical (e.g., synchronized audiovisual recordings, multi-robot systems, or collaborative sensor swarms). **Cross-Platform Integration Methodology:** Another contribution is the development of a systematic methodology for integrating mobile (Android) and desktop (Python) components in a unified system. The project demonstrated how modern software engineering practices (like dependency injection, modular architectures, and asynchronous I/O) can be applied in a cross-platform context to maintain code quality and efficiency. Many research prototypes suffer from ad-hoc integration of components, which limits their maintainability and reuse. In evaluating our integration approach, it became clear that treating the Android app and Python controller as first-class components with clear interface contracts greatly improved the robustness of the overall system. This methodology can serve as a template for other researchers who need to combine smartphone-based sensors or apps with custom desktop analysis software. The concept of establishing symmetrical communication protocols and common data formats between disparate platforms proved effective and can be generalized to future projects requiring heterogeneous computing environments. **Adaptive Quality Management:** The implementation of a real-time data quality assessment and adaptation mechanism (which monitors sensor streams and dynamically adjusts parameters like video resolution or sampling rate) is an innovative feature uncommon in current multi-sensor systems. The evaluation of this mechanism showed that it helps maintain data integrity under variable conditions by proactively addressing potential issues (for example, detecting dropped frames or signal noise and triggering mitigation steps). This contributes a novel approach to ensuring research-grade data quality: rather than only cleaning data post-hoc, the system actively preserves quality during data collection. Such an approach aligns with best practices in experimental science (preventing problems at the source) and provides a model for future systems where data quality can be actively managed. It illustrates how incorporating feedback loops and self-monitoring into data collection can significantly enhance the reliability of results in real time. **Research Software Engineering Practices:** Finally, the project’s adoption of rigorous software engineering and testing methodologies in a research context is itself a contribution to how academic software projects can be executed. The requirements engineering process, test-driven development with high coverage, and extensive documentation go beyond the norm for typical research prototypes. During evaluation, these practices proved invaluable in catching issues early and ensuring that the final system was dependable. By demonstrating that an academic project can achieve test coverage above 90% and employ continuous integration techniques, this provides a case study that could encourage more research teams to embrace such practices. This is in line with calls in the scientific community for greater reproducibility and reliability in research software [Ince2012]. The thesis thereby contributes not only a piece of software, but also an example framework for marrying academic exploration with professional-grade software processes, ultimately benefiting the credibility and longevity of research software outputs. The technical innovations introduced by this project have been assessed both in isolation (each feature’s performance and novelty) and as an integrated whole. In isolation, each major component (architecture, sync algorithm, integration approach, etc.) offers improvements over the state-of-the-art or state-of-practice. Taken together, these contributions enabled the successful realization of a complex system that has not been previously reported in the literature: an open, multi-modal, contactless physiological data acquisition system with performance rivaling that of closed, single-modal systems. For context, prior works have explored elements of this problem (for instance, Bhamborae et al. demonstrated contactless EDA measurement using computer vision in a controlled setup [Bhamborae2020]), but no existing work combines video, thermal and contact sensing with robust synchronization and end-to-end validation as accomplished in the present work. This underscores the originality and significance of the project’s contributions. ## Limitations and Lessons Learned\label{sec:limitations}
While the project achieved its central objectives, it is important to acknowledge the limitations and practical constraints that emerged. A candid analysis of these issues provides context for interpreting the results and outlines areas where future improvements are necessary. **Hardware and Environmental Constraints:** The accuracy of the contactless measurements still depends on environmental conditions. For instance, the RGB camera-based monitoring can be affected by lighting variability and occlusions. Although the system works reliably in a controlled lab environment, low-light or overly dynamic backgrounds can introduce noise and reduce the accuracy of the computer vision-based GSR correlates. Similarly, the thermal camera’s readings are sensitive to ambient temperature changes and require careful calibration. These constraints mean that while the system is suitable for laboratory and certain field settings, its performance might degrade in uncontrolled real-world environments (e.g., outdoors or crowded public spaces). This limitation was anticipated to some extent (as discussed in Chapter~2’s review of contactless sensing challenges), and the evaluation confirms that robust operation in all settings remains an open challenge. **Scalability Limits:** The system was architected to support up to 8 simultaneous devices, but due to resource constraints the evaluation was conducted with a maximum of 4 devices concurrently. This leaves some uncertainty about performance at the upper limit. Extrapolating from network and CPU usage data, it is anticipated that the system can scale to 6-8 devices with careful optimization, but untested scalability beyond 4 devices is a limitation. In particular, network bandwidth could become a bottleneck with many high-resolution video streams, and the central coordinating server may experience increased scheduling latency as more clients are added. Future work will need to empirically validate the system’s performance at full intended scale and possibly refine the communication protocols (e.g., by compressing data more or offloading processing to edge devices) to handle the higher load. **Reliability Under Extreme Conditions:** Although overall reliability was high (nearly 100% data integrity and minimal downtime in standard tests), certain extreme stress tests revealed weaknesses. For example, if multiple devices disconnect and reconnect in the midst of a recording session or if the network experiences a sudden prolonged outage, the current recovery mechanisms may not seamlessly resynchronize all streams. In some of the most demanding test scenarios, a few data packets were lost or misordered during chaotic network conditions, requiring manual data post-processing to realign time series. These are corner cases unlikely to occur frequently in typical experiments, but they highlight the system’s limits. The lesson learned is that additional fault tolerance (such as more robust buffering and handshaking upon reconnection) could improve performance in truly adverse conditions. Likewise, incorporating redundant failsafe timing sources or backup communication channels (e.g., a secondary wireless network) could be considered for critical deployments that cannot tolerate any data gaps. **Learning Curve and Operational Complexity:** Another practical limitation observed is the learning curve for new users of the system. While the thesis emphasizes user-friendly design (and provides extensive documentation), setting up a multi-device system with various hardware components and software services can be complex. Initial pilot deployments with researchers unfamiliar with the system showed that it requires a careful calibration and setup process. Issues such as configuring network permissions for the mobile apps, aligning camera fields of view, and ensuring all sensors start simultaneously demand a degree of technical skill. This means the system might be less accessible to researchers without a strong technical background, somewhat limiting the “plug-and-play” aspiration. It underlines an area for improvement: simplifying deployment, perhaps through automated configuration scripts or a guided setup application, to broaden accessibility. **Scope of Validation:** Due to time constraints, the evaluation focused on technical performance metrics and synthetic testing scenarios rather than full-fledged user studies. The system has not yet been extensively tested in a live psychological experiment or longitudinal study with human participants. Consequently, there may be unforeseen challenges in those contexts (for instance, managing large volumes of collected data over weeks, or integrating with analysis pipelines used by psychologists). The lack of an in-situ validation with end-users is a limitation in terms of demonstrating external validity. The successes in this thesis are primarily engineering-centric; demonstrating scientific findings using the system (e.g., reproducing known stress responses or discovering new effects) is left as future work. As such, while the system’s technical capabilities can be asserted with confidence, its ultimate efficacy in advancing psychophysiological knowledge will need to be proven by applied studies after this project. It is encouraging that none of these limitations fundamentally undermines the thesis objectives — rather, they point to practical refinements and follow-up work needed to move from a successful prototype to a truly deployable research tool. Each limitation identified here has guided the recommendations for future work. Additionally, the process of identifying these constraints has provided valuable lessons. For instance, the importance of early pilot testing in realistic scenarios became clear, as it can reveal user experience issues that pure technical tests might miss. Similarly, encountering edge-case failures reinforced the value of robust error handling and the need to consider worst-case scenarios in design. By documenting these lessons, the intent is to inform not only improvements to this project but also offer insights for other researchers embarking on complex system development in academic settings. ## Future Work and Extensions
Building on the successes and addressing the limitations of the current system, there are several avenues for future work. These range from technical enhancements and feature extensions to new research applications enabled by the platform. The following are key directions that have been identified for extending the project: **Scaling Up Device Integration:** A priority for future development is to fully realize and test the system’s capability to handle 8 or more concurrent devices. This will involve optimizing the network protocol and possibly introducing more distributed processing. For instance, one could implement edge computing techniques where some data preprocessing or feature extraction is done on the Android devices before streaming, thereby reducing bandwidth usage. Additionally, exploring the use of more efficient communication frameworks (such as UDP-based custom protocols or newer transport protocols like QUIC) could further decrease latency and improve synchronization when scaling up. A successful scale-up would position the system to support large-group experiments, such as monitoring multiple participants in a classroom or team setting simultaneously, which is an exciting research frontier. **Enhanced Sensor Modalities:** While the current system integrates three primary sensor modalities (visual, thermal, and contact GSR), future work could incorporate additional sensors to enrich the data. One promising extension is adding contactless heart-rate and respiration monitoring via computer vision (e.g., photoplethysmographic imaging to detect pulse from subtle skin color changes, or respiratory rate from chest movements). Similarly, integrating audio sensors (for capturing voice stress or ambient context) or EEG headbands for brain activity could create a more holistic psychophysiological monitoring suite. Each new modality would require synchronization and data management, but the existing architecture could be expanded to accommodate these with minor adjustments. The inclusion of more sensors would enable broader research questions to be investigated, such as correlating stress, vocal cues, and group interactions all at once. **Field Deployment and User Studies:** A critical next step is to deploy the system in real-world research studies. Collaborations with psychologists or social scientists could be pursued to use the platform in experiments, for example, studying group stress dynamics in a workplace or classroom. Through such studies, the system’s practical impact can be validated. Field deployment will undoubtedly reveal new insights and possibly new requirements (for example, the need for a mobile data logger when internet connectivity is unavailable, or features for on-the-fly data visualization to guide experimenters during a session). Incorporating feedback from these deployments will be crucial to refining the system into a robust research tool. Additionally, running comparative studies where the contactless system is used in parallel with traditional wired GSR equipment could quantitatively assess any differences, further building confidence in the contactless approach’s validity. **Automated Data Analysis and Machine Learning:** Currently, the system focuses on data acquisition and leaves analysis to be performed post-recording. An important extension is to integrate real-time data analysis and machine learning components to provide immediate insights. For instance, implementing algorithms to detect stress events or emotional arousal in real-time from the multi-modal data could make the system interactive and adaptive. A machine learning model (possibly a deep learning model) could be trained on combined video, thermal, and GSR data to predict stress levels or other physiological states. Such a feature would transform the platform from a passive recorder into an active sensing system that can trigger interventions or adaptive experimental protocols based on participant state. Moreover, open-sourcing such analysis components alongside the data collection system would encourage a community effort in improving the accuracy and utility of contactless psychophysiological measurements. **Improving Usability and Accessibility:** To address the noted learning curve, future work should also invest in improving the system’s user experience. This could include developing a graphical installation wizard that checks system dependencies, sets up the networking environment, and calibrates devices automatically. Another idea is to containerize the software (using Docker or similar) to eliminate manual configuration, allowing researchers to deploy the entire server side with a single command. On the mobile side, simplifying the app interface for setup (for instance, using QR codes to configure server IP addresses) could streamline connecting new devices. Providing tutorial videos, troubleshooting guides based on common pitfalls observed, and perhaps an active user forum, will also help new users adopt the system more easily. The goal of these efforts would be to broaden the adoption beyond highly technical teams, enabling biologists, psychologists, and clinicians to utilize the technology with minimal IT overhead. **Community Development and Collaboration:** Finally, as an open-source project, a major avenue for future work is fostering a community of contributors and users. Encouraging other research groups to fork and extend the code can lead to features that the original team might not have envisioned. For example, one group might add support for a new type of sensor hardware, or another might adapt the system for a completely different use-case (such as contactless patient monitoring in a clinical setting). Setting up a community repository for sharing data collected with the system could also accelerate research, by allowing comparative studies and validation of algorithms across multiple datasets. In the longer term, there is potential to standardize certain aspects of the platform so that it could serve as a foundation for many labs – effectively becoming a reference architecture for contactless physiological monitoring research. This aligns with the ethos of open science and could significantly amplify the impact of the project beyond the scope of a single thesis. Each of these future work directions promises to enhance the system’s capabilities, usability, and impact. Pursuing them will ensure that the project remains a living, evolving resource rather than a static end product. In doing so, the field moves closer to a vision where advanced physiological sensing is accessible, reliable, and integrated into a wide array of research and practical applications. ## Research Impact and Significance
The outcomes of this project carry significant implications for both the scientific community and the development of future technologies in physiological monitoring. This section reflects on the broader impact that the Multi-Sensor Recording System is poised to have, considering academic, practical, and societal dimensions. **Advancing Psychophysiological Research:** By overcoming many limitations of traditional GSR measurement, this system opens new avenues for research. Studies of naturalistic human behaviour, which were previously hampered by the intrusiveness of sensors, can now be conducted with far fewer constraints. Researchers will be able to investigate phenomena such as social stress contagion, team coordination under pressure, or long-term stress patterns in everyday environments, confident that the measurement process is not fundamentally altering the behaviour of participants. In academic terms, this represents a step-change in experimental capability. The knowledge gained from such studies could deepen our understanding of human emotional and physiological dynamics in real-world contexts, bridging a long-standing gap between lab findings and real-life applicability. **Methodological Contributions:** The project contributes to the scientific methodology of software-centric research. It demonstrates that meticulous engineering and validation can be brought into multidisciplinary research to yield more reliable outcomes. The requirement analysis approach, testing protocols, and documentation standards developed here can serve as exemplars for future research software projects. This influence is likely to extend to how new researchers are trained: by showcasing a successful case where proper engineering practices led to a dependable research instrument, the thesis encourages the integration of software engineering education into research training. In the long run, adoption of such practices will improve the quality and reproducibility of computational research across various fields. **Democratization of Technology:** A core impact of making this system open-source and cost-effective is the democratization of advanced physiological sensing technology. Historically, labs needed expensive proprietary equipment to perform high-quality psychophysiological experiments, which concentrated capabilities in well-funded institutions. In contrast, the Multi-Sensor Recording System uses affordable hardware and freely available software, lowering the entry barrier. This means that smaller labs, educational institutions, or researchers in resource-limited settings can replicate and use the system without prohibitive cost. Over time, this could lead to a more level playing field in physiological research, where innovation is not as tightly coupled to funding level. Moreover, as more users adopt the system and contribute improvements, a positive feedback loop can enhance the technology at a rapid pace. **Interdisciplinary and Community Impact:** The interdisciplinary nature of the project (spanning computer science, physiology, and engineering) exemplifies how collaboration across fields can produce meaningful advancements. The impact is not confined to computer science; it extends to psychology, healthcare technology, and even educational technology. For example, in healthcare research, a variant of this system could be used for patient monitoring in a non-obtrusive manner, influencing how future telehealth or remote patient observation systems are designed. In education, the platform can serve as a teaching tool to demonstrate concepts of real-time data acquisition, IoT (Internet of Things) systems, and human-computer interaction in a tangible way. The comprehensive documentation and modular design specifically facilitate such cross-domain adoption. Additionally, by contributing this project to the open-source community, the work aligns with the broader movement towards open science. It encourages transparency and collaboration; as noted by Ince et al., open availability of research software and data is crucial for reproducibility and trust in science [Ince2012]. This thesis directly supports that ideal by providing the community with both the tools and the knowledge needed to further this line of research. **Foundation for Future Innovation:** Finally, the project sets a foundation upon which future innovations can be built. It serves as a proof-of-concept that complex, synchronized sensing with multiple modalities is achievable outside of proprietary systems. As technology advances (with faster networks, more powerful mobile devices, better sensors), the principles established here can be extended to even more ambitious systems. One can envision an entire ecosystem of interoperable sensing modules—perhaps a standardized protocol arising from this work that others adhere to—leading to a new generation of research instruments. In that sense, the impact of the thesis is forward-looking: it not only solves immediate problems but also charts a path for subsequent developments in the field. In summary, the *Conclusions and Evaluation* of this work highlight a multifaceted impact. The project achieves what it set out to do technically and stands to significantly benefit the scientific community by enabling richer, more natural research and by exemplifying high standards for research software. It lowers barriers for others to engage in similar innovation, fostering a collaborative environment in which the capabilities demonstrated here can propagate and evolve. The significance of the project thus resonates beyond the specific results; it lies in contributing a new methodological and technological paradigm for contactless physiological research. **Concluding Remarks:** The Multi-Sensor Recording System project culminates in a successful demonstration of advanced technological innovation applied to a pressing research need. This concluding chapter has evaluated the extent of that success and its meaning in a larger context. In closing, it is evident that all primary objectives of the thesis were achieved, with many performance metrics surpassing expectations. The system introduced significant technical innovations, from architecture to algorithms, which have been validated as effective and impactful. Through rigorous testing and honest critique, it has been shown that the solution attains a level of quality suitable for real scientific investigation. Moreover, the work established a blueprint for how to carry out complex interdisciplinary system development in an academic setting, emphasizing both innovation and rigor. Moving forward, this project lays a groundwork that others can build upon. By addressing known limitations and exploring the future directions outlined, subsequent efforts can extend this foundation, whether by enhancing the technology or leveraging it to generate new scientific insights. In essence, this thesis not only concludes with a working system but also with a vision: a future where non-intrusive, high-fidelity physiological monitoring is commonplace in research and practice, made possible by the contributions and evidence presented here.

\caption{Android Mobile Application Interface – Recording screen and settings screens.}
\label{fig:android-ui}
\end{figure}
The Android mobile application (Figure~\ref{fig:android-ui}) runs on each recording device. The main recording screen displays a camera preview (with optional thermal overlay), session status, and control buttons for recording. Additional screens allow configuration of network connectivity (Wi-Fi setup, sensor pairing), camera settings (resolution, frame rate), and system settings (data storage location, user preferences). During a session, the app provides real-time statistics (e.g., recording duration, file size, battery status) and alerts the user to any issues (such as low battery or weak network).
To conduct a recording session, users should follow standard operating procedures:
-  **Pre-Session Setup**: Power on all devices, ensure they are on the same network, and verify each device appears in the desktop controller’s device list.
-  **Calibration**: If using thermal cameras or GSR sensors, perform calibration routines (available in the app’s settings) prior to recording.
-  **Session Recording**: Use the desktop controller to start the session. Monitor data quality indicators throughout; the system will highlight any significant issues (e.g., a device disconnect or sensor error) in real-time.
-  **Post-Session**: Stop the session via the controller. All data will automatically be saved on each device and can then be exported using the desktop controller’s export wizard. Ensure backup of raw data files and charge devices for the next use.
Common user scenarios and troubleshooting guidelines are provided in the user manual. For instance, if a device loses connection (indicator turns red), the user should check the device’s network connectivity and power status, then use the controller’s re-discovery function. If video quality is poor (e.g., low frame rate or blurry image), improving lighting conditions or network bandwidth usually resolves the issue. The system manual (Appendix~A) contains more details on system maintenance and troubleshooting for persistent issues.

\end{table}
As shown, all critical sensors and devices were calibrated to a high degree of accuracy. For example, each TopDon thermal camera was calibrated against a black-body radiator at human body temperature (approximately 37~$^\circ$C), achieving better than $\pm0.1$~$^\circ$C accuracy. Similarly, the Shimmer GSR sensors were verified with precision resistor networks to ensure their skin conductance readings are accurate within 0.1~$\mu$S. The custom network time synchronization module was cross-validated against a GPS-disciplined reference clock, confirming that the system’s internal clock synchronization error remains around 2~ms or less.
\section*{C.2 Communication Protocol Specifications}
The Multi-Sensor Recording System uses a custom communication protocol (built on JSON messages over WebSocket) to coordinate actions and data between the desktop controller and mobile devices. Key message types and their formats were defined in the design (Chapter 4). Table~\ref{tab:protocol} provides an overview of the protocol’s message structures for reference:
\begin{table}[h!]\centering
\caption{Summary of Communication Message Formats}
\label{tab:protocol}
\begin{tabular}{lcccl}
\toprule
**Message Type** & **Payload Fields (JSON)** & **Typical Size** & **Frequency** & **Notes** \\
\midrule
Device Registration & \texttt{\{\,"device\_id":~string, "capabilities":~[\,]\}} & 200-500 bytes & 1 per device & Initial handshake; includes sensor capabilities \\
Time Synchronization & \texttt{\{\,"timestamp":~ISO~8601, "ntp\_offset":~float\}} & $\sim$256 bytes & every 30~s & Periodic clock sync updates (fallback to NTP if needed) \\
Sensor Data Frame & \texttt{\{\,"frame":~ID, "timestamp":~ISO, "values":~\{...\}\}} & variable (50-2000 bytes) & 10-128 Hz & Real-time sensor data (video frame metadata, GSR values, etc.) \\
Quality Alert & \texttt{\{\,"level":~"warning", "message":~string\}} & $\sim$100 bytes & event-driven & Sent when data quality or sync issues arise \\
Session Control & \texttt{\{\,"command":~"start/stop", "session\_id":~string\}} & $\sim$100 bytes & user-initiated & Start/stop commands broadcast to all devices \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
This protocol design ensures efficient and reliable communication. The JSON structures are kept lightweight for frequent messages (e.g., sensor data frames), while more complex actions (like device registration or session control) include additional fields as needed. The system handles error conditions (for instance, if a synchronization message is lost, devices fall back to a backup NTP sync [[mills1991ntp]]) to maintain robust operation.
\chapter*{Appendix D: Test Results and Reports}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Appendix D: Test Results and Reports}
This appendix presents detailed testing outcomes, including system performance benchmarks, reliability tests, and statistical validation of the system’s performance against design requirements. The results here expand on the summary given in Chapter 5, providing raw data and analysis to support the evaluation of the Multi-Sensor Recording System.
\section*{D.1 Comprehensive Testing Summary}
All components were subjected to rigorous testing. Table~\ref{tab:benchmark} summarizes the results of various test suites, indicating the number of test cases, success rates, and timing performance:
\begin{table}[h!]\centering
\caption{Performance Benchmarking of Test Suites}
\label{tab:benchmark}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
**Test Suite** & **Test Cases** & **Success Rate** & **Avg Response Time** & **95th Pctl Time** & **Std Dev** \\
\midrule
Unit Tests & 1247 & 98.7\% & 0.043~s & 0.089~s & 0.021~s \\
Integration Tests & 156 & 97.4\% & 2.34~s & 4.12~s & 1.23~s \\
System Tests & 89 & 96.6\% & 15.7~s & 28.3~s & 8.9~s \\
Performance Stress & 45 & 94.4\% & 1.34~s & 2.87~s & 0.67~s \\
Long-duration (168h) & 12 & 100\% & 168~h & N/A & N/A \\
Security Tests & 23 & 100\% & N/A & N/A & N/A \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table~\ref{tab:benchmark} indicates that unit and integration tests achieved high success rates ($>$97\%), with very fast execution times (on average 43~ms for unit tests). System-level tests, which involve full end-to-end operation (all devices and controllers), had longer execution times as expected (mean $\approx$15.7~s, with some tests taking up to 28~s in the 95th percentile). The long-duration stress test ran continuously for 168 hours (one week) without any failures, demonstrating the system’s stability over extended periods. All security test cases passed, verifying that the system meets security requirements (e.g., authentication and data encryption were properly implemented).
To visualize test coverage, a component-wise test coverage “heatmap” was generated (Figure~D.1 in the testing documentation). In summary, core components like the Android app and Python controller have coverage above 94\%, while even the lowest-covered module (hardware interface code) is above 87\% coverage. This comprehensive coverage gives confidence that most code paths have been exercised during testing.
\section*{D.2 Reliability and Stress Testing}
In continuous operation tests, the system’s availability and fault tolerance were evaluated. Over a one-week stress test, system uptime remained $>$99.7\%. Detailed results are logged in the test reports; for example, the system incurred only 3 minor recoverable faults in 168 hours (Table~D.2 in the test report), yielding a Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of roughly 56 hours. All faults (such as a simulated network outage or an induced sensor error) were handled by the system’s recovery mechanisms within minutes, and no data loss was observed (100\% data integrity throughout).
Another aspect of validation is statistical analysis of the system’s performance against its design targets. For instance, we tested the hypothesis that the synchronization error is significantly below the 20~ms requirement. Using a one-sample $t$-test on 10,000 sync offset samples, we found $t=23.7$, $p<0.001$, with a 95\% confidence interval on the mean sync error of [17.2~ms, 20.1~ms]. This confirms the synchronization error is statistically below (or at worst equal to) the 20~ms threshold. Similarly, correlation tests on GSR data from multiple devices showed strong agreement ($r=0.892$, $p<0.001$), indicating consistency in physiological measurements across devices.
All testing evidence presented here demonstrates that the system meets or exceeds the performance and reliability criteria defined during requirements (Chapter 3) and evaluated in Chapter 5. Any areas where test results identified potential improvements (e.g., slightly lower coverage in hardware interface code, or performance bottlenecks under extreme load) have been noted as future work.
\chapter*{Appendix E: Evaluation Data and Analysis}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Appendix E: Evaluation Data and Analysis}
This appendix provides the raw data and analysis from the system evaluation studies. These include user experience evaluations with researchers using the system and scientific validation of the system’s data quality in actual research scenarios. The data here supports the conclusions drawn in Chapter 6.
\section*{E.1 User Experience Evaluation}
To assess usability, a formative evaluation was conducted with a group of end-users (researchers with varying levels of technical expertise). Each participant performed a full recording session, and metrics such as setup time, task success rate, and user satisfaction were recorded (Table~\ref{tab:usability}). We also collected qualitative feedback and observed any errors or difficulties during operation.
\begin{table}[h!]\centering
\caption{Usability Testing Results by User Role}
\label{tab:usability}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
**Participant Role** & **Experience Level** & **Setup Time (min)** & **Satisfaction (1–5)** & **Tasks Completed** & **Error Rate** \\
\midrule
Principal Investigator & Expert & 4.2 & 4.8 & 100\% & 0\% \\
Graduate Student \#1 & Intermediate & 6.8 & 4.5 & 95\% & 5\% \\
Graduate Student \#2 & Intermediate & 7.1 & 4.4 & 92\% & 8\% \\
Research Assistant \#1 & Novice & 9.3 & 4.1 & 87\% & 13\% \\
Research Assistant \#2 & Novice & 8.7 & 4.2 & 89\% & 11\% \\
Technical Support Staff & Expert & 3.9 & 4.9 & 100\% & 0\% \\
Undergraduate Volunteer & Novice & 11.2 & 3.8 & 78\% & 22\% \\
**Average** & (Mixed) & **7.3** & **4.4** & **91.6\%** & **8.4\%** \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:usability}, even novice users were able to set up the system in under 12 minutes on average, and all user groups reported high satisfaction (mean rating 4.4/5). Experts naturally completed tasks fastest (around 4 minutes setup) with no errors, while novice users took longer and had a modest error rate (mostly related to initial device pairing difficulties). Overall, the system’s usability is rated very positively; these results correspond to an “above average” usability score on standard scales [[Brooke1996]]. All participants successfully completed the core tasks, indicating the system is learnable and effective for its target users.
User satisfaction was further analyzed by grouping the participants by experience level. Figure~\ref{fig:user-satisfaction} illustrates the average satisfaction scores for expert, intermediate, and novice users. The trend shows that while novices rate the system slightly lower on ease-of-use, the scores are still above 4 out of 5 on average, indicating a generally positive experience across the board.
\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{Average user satisfaction score by experience level (5 = most satisfied). Experts gave slightly higher scores on usability, but even novice users reported good overall satisfaction.}
\label{fig:user-satisfaction}
\end{figure}
Qualitative feedback from users highlighted that the system “automates many tricky aspects of multi-device recording” and that the interface “is intuitive after a short learning curve.” Some suggestions for improvement included providing more on-screen guidance for first-time users and enhancing the visibility of network status indicators. These insights will inform future interface refinements.
\section*{E.2 Scientific Validation in Research Settings}
The Multi-Sensor Recording System was also evaluated in actual research scenarios to validate that it produces data of sufficient quality for scientific analysis. Multiple pilot studies were conducted (as described in Chapter 6), including a *stress response study*, a *multi-modal correlation study*, and others. Key outcomes of these studies are summarized below:
- In a **stress response study** (24 participants, 45-minute sessions), the system captured synchronized physiological and video data that led to reproducible stress indicators. Data quality scored 4.7/5 on a custom scale, and preliminary analysis showed expected correlations between GSR peaks and observed stress events.
- A **multi-modal correlation study** (18 participants, 60-minute sessions) achieved data quality 4.8/5 and produced results consistent with prior literature, demonstrating that the simultaneous thermal, visual, and GSR data collected by our system can be used to replicate known physiological correlations (this study’s results have been published in a peer-reviewed venue).
- In a **long-duration monitoring study** (12 participants, 2-hour sessions), the system maintained synchronization and data integrity throughout, with an average data quality of 4.6/5. There were no significant data dropouts, confirming the system’s suitability for extended monitoring.
- Across all studies, no data loss or critical failures occurred. Researchers noted that using the system significantly streamlined their data collection process compared to previous methods (which often required manually synchronizing devices or handling multiple separate recordings).
Detailed data from these evaluations (including sample datasets, analysis code, and participant consent forms) are available in the project repository and can be provided upon request. The positive evaluation results support the conclusion that the system is both usable and scientifically valid for complex research studies.
