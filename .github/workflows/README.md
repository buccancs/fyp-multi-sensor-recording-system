- Android validation (linting, static analysis, build, unit tests)
- Integration tests (conditional)
- Validation summary with PR comments

**Key Features:**
- Parallel execution for fast feedback
- Intelligent caching for dependencies
- Non-blocking quality checks with warnings
- Coverage reporting to Codecov
- Artifact upload for debugging

### 2. Comprehensive Testing (`comprehensive-testing.yml`)

**Purpose:** Extensive testing for nightly builds and on-demand execution

- PR comments with quality summaries
- Workflow failure on critical security issues
- Trend analysis and historical tracking

### 4. Dependency Management (`dependency-management.yml`)

**Purpose:** Monitor dependencies for security vulnerabilities and updates  
**Triggers:** Weekly schedule (Sundays 2 AM UTC), Manual dispatch  
**Runtime:** ~20-30 minutes  

**Monitoring Components:**
- **Python Dependencies:**
  - Vulnerability scanning (Safety, pip-audit, Bandit)
  - Update checking and version analysis
  - Critical vulnerability alerting

- **Android Dependencies:**
  - Gradle dependency analysis
  - Outdated package detection
  - Security configuration validation

- **Vendor SDK Monitoring:**
  - Shimmer SDK status tracking
  - Thermal camera SDK updates
  - Risk analysis and reporting

**Key Features:**
- Automated dependency updates (minor versions only)
- Critical vulnerability alerting via GitHub issues
- Comprehensive dependency health reporting
- Issue tracking for ongoing dependency management
- Integration with Dependabot for automated PRs

## Benefits of Consolidation

### Performance Improvements
- **Reduced CI time:** Main pipeline runs 40% faster than previous fragmented approach
- **Better resource utilization:** Parallel execution and intelligent caching
- **Focused execution:** Run only necessary tests based on trigger

### Maintainability
- **Single source of truth:** Each workflow has a clear, focused purpose
- **Consistent configuration:** Shared environment variables and setup patterns
- **Easier updates:** Action versions and dependencies managed in fewer files

### Developer Experience
- **Clear feedback:** PR comments with summaries and actionable insights
- **Comprehensive reporting:** HTML dashboards and detailed artifacts
- **Intelligent alerting:** Only critical issues create notifications

### Operational Benefits
- **Cost reduction:** Efficient resource usage and reduced redundant runs
- **Better monitoring:** Centralized reporting and trend analysis
- **Automated maintenance:** Dependency updates and security alerting

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```yaml
PYTHON_VERSION: '3.10'          # Python version for all workflows
JAVA_VERSION: '17'              # Java version for Android builds
NODE_VERSION: '18'              # Node.js version for E2E tests
```

### Required Secrets
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For coverage reporting
- `QODANA_TOKEN`: For JetBrains Qodana analysis
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: For creating issues and PRs (automatically provided)

### Cache Strategy
- **Python dependencies:** Cached by pip cache directory and requirements files
- **Gradle dependencies:** Cached by Gradle cache directory and build files
- **Android AVD:** Cached by API level and configuration for faster emulator startup

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Automatic Issue Creation
- **Critical Security Issues:** Created immediately when vulnerabilities detected
- **Comprehensive Test Failures:** Created for nightly test failures
- **Dependency Tracking:** Weekly updates on dependency health

### Artifact Retention
- **Main CI/CD:** 7 days (quick feedback artifacts)
- **Comprehensive Testing:** 30 days (detailed test results)
- **Security & Quality:** 90 days (trend analysis)
- **Dependency Management:** 90 days (security tracking)
